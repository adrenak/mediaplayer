1
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,090
People are always asking me

2
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,750
if I know Tyler Durden.

3
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,520
3 minutes.

4
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,720
This is it - ground zero.

5
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,850
Would you like to say a few
words to mark the occasion?

6
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,890
With a gun barrel
between your teeth,

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,060
you speak only in vowels.

8
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,400
I can't think
of anything.

9
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,060
For a second
I totally forget

10
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,660
about Tyler's whole
controlled demolition thing,

11
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,870
and I wonder
how clean that gun is.

12
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,740
Getting
exciting now.

13
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,800
That old saying,

14
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,070
how you always hurt
the one you love?

15
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,340
Well, it works both ways.

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,550
We have front row seats

17
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,610
for this theater
of mass destruction.

18
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,020
The demolitions committee
of Project Mayhem

19
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,560
wrapped the foundation
columns of a dozen buildings

20
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,560
with blasting gelatin.
In 2 minutes,

21
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,560
primary charges
will blow base charges

22
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,820
and a few square blocks

23
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,630
will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.

24
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,760
I know this...

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,530
because Tyler knows this.

26
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
21/2.

27
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,210
Think of everything
we've accomplished.

28
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,240
And suddenly, I realize
that all of this

29
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,810
the gun, the bombs,
the revolution...

30
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,340
has got something to do with
a girl named Marla Singer.

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Bob. Bob had bitch-tits.

32
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,980
This was a support group for
men with testicular cancer.

33
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,530
The big moosey
slobbering all over me,

34
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,560
that was Bob.

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,790
We're still men.

36
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,830
Yes, we're men.

37
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,400
Men is what we are.

38
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,490
8 months ago, Bob's
testicles were removed.

39
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,060
Then hormone therapy.
He developed bitch-tits

40
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,140
because his testosterone
was too high,

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,010
and his body
upped the estrogen.

42
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,340
And that was where I fit...

43
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,380
They're gonna have to
open up my pecs again

44
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,440
and drain the fluid.

45
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,380
Between those huge,
sweating tits

46
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,820
that hung enormous the way
you'd think of God's as big.

47
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,920
OK. You cry now.

48
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,520
No, wait. Back up.
Let me start earlier.

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,630
For 6 months,
I couldn't sleep.

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,220
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep.

51
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,460
With insomnia,
nothing's real.

52
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,130
Everything's far away.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,010
Everything's a copy
of a copy of a copy.

54
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,140
When deep space
exploration ramps up,

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,880
it'll be the corporations
that name everything...

56
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:21,480
the I.B.M. Stellarsphere,

57
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,520
the Microsoft Galaxy,

58
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,110
Planet Starbucks.

59
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,780
Gonna need you out of town
a little more this week.

60
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,360
We got some
red flags to cover.

61
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,830
It must've been Tuesday.

62
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,960
He was wearing
his cornflower-blue tie.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,160
You want me to deprioritize
my current reports

64
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,670
until you advise
of a status upgrade?

65
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,500
Make these your primary
action items.

66
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,660
Here's
your flight coupons.

67
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,300
Call me from the road
if there's any snags.

68
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,840
He was full of pep.

69
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,110
Must have had
his grande latte enema.

70
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,970
Like so many others,
I had become a slave

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,350
<i>to the IKEA
nesting instinct.</i>

72
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,360
Uh, yes. I'd like to order
the Erica Pekkary dust ruffles.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,390
Please hold.

74
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,690
If I saw something clever

75
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,760
like a little coffee table
in the shape of a yin-yang,

76
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,630
I had to have it.

77
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,560
The Klipske
personal office unit,

78
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,070
the Hovetrekke
home exer-bike,

79
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,800
or the Johannshamn sofa

80
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,140
with the Strinne green
stripe pattern.

81
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,170
Even the Rizlampa wire lamps

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,300
of environmentally friendly
unbleached paper.

83
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,210
I'd flip through catalogs
and wonder...

84
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,310
What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,780
I had it all.

86
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,980
Even the glass dishes

87
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,990
with tiny bubbles
and imperfections.

88
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,150
Proof that they were crafted
by the honest, simple,

89
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,950
hard-working indigenous
peoples of...

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,990
Please hold.

91
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,990
Wherever.

92
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,360
I was holding.

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,990
We used to read pornography.

94
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,160
Now it was
the Horchow collection.

95
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,240
No, you can't
die from insomnia.

96
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,400
What about narcolepsy?

97
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,440
I nod off. I wake up
in strange places.

98
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,000
I have no idea
how I got there.

99
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,810
You need to lighten up.

100
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,180
Can you please just
get me something?

101
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,450
Red and blue Tuenols,
lipstick-red Seconals.

102
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,150
No. You need
healthy natural sleep.

103
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,780
Chew some Valerian root
and get more exercise.

104
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,930
Hey, come on.
I'm in pain.

105
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,800
You wanna see pain?

106
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,600
Swing by First Methodist
Tuesday nights.

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,760
See the guys
with testicular cancer.

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,470
That's pain.

109
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,040
La la la

110
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,450
La la la la la la

111
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,250
I always wanted 3 kids,

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,290
2 boys and a girl.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,260
Mindy wanted
2 girls and a boy.

114
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,270
We never could
agree on anything.

115
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,300
Well, uh,
you know, she...

116
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,860
She had her first child
last week, a...

117
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,700
a girl.

118
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,330
With... With her, uh,
with her new husband.

119
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,810
Fuck.

120
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:04,910
Hey... Hey, thank God,
you know.

121
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,420
I'm... I'm glad for her.

122
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,820
Because she deserves it.

123
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,450
Aw.

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,050
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,460
Thank you, Thomas.

126
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,800
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage,

127
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,930
and that gives me strength.

128
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,440
We give each other strength.

129
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,440
It's time
for the one-on-ones.

130
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,270
So let's all of us here
follow Thomas' good example

131
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,810
and really open ourselves up.

132
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,110
Would you find a partner?

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,650
And this is how
I met the big moosey...

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,810
Come on.
Let's go over here.

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,120
His eyes already
shrink-wrapped in tears...

136
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,830
knees together,
those awkward little steps.

137
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,800
My name is Bob.

138
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,370
Bob.

139
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,910
Bob had been
a champion body-builder.

140
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,940
You know that
chest-expansion program

141
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,070
you see on late-night TV?
That was his idea.

142
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,910
I was a juicer.

143
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,610
You know,
using steroids.

144
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,420
Diabonal and...

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,960
Wistrol.
Oh, they use that

146
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,290
on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

147
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,090
And now I'm bankrupt.

148
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,290
I'm divorced.

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,840
My 2 grown kids...

150
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,670
won't even return
my phone calls.

151
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,440
Strangers
with this kind of honesty

152
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,010
make me go
a big rubbery one.

153
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,820
Go ahead, Cornelius.

154
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
You can cry.

155
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,630
And then,
something happened.

156
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,100
I let go.

157
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,660
That's really good.

158
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,710
Lost in oblivion...

159
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,900
dark and silent
and complete.

160
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,440
I found freedom.

161
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,250
Losing all hope was freedom.

162
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,290
It's OK.

163
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,790
Babies don't sleep
this well.

164
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,930
I became addicted.

165
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,480
Come on.

166
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,910
If I didn't say anything...

167
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,780
people always
assumed the worst.

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,820
Welcome, Travis.

169
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,790
Second Welcome, Travis.

170
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,650
They cried harder...

171
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,920
then I cried harder.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,270
Now we're going
to open the green door,

173
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,930
the heart chakra.

174
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,270
I wasn't really dying.

175
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,280
I wasn't host to cancer
or parasites.

176
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,470
I was the warm little center

177
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,770
that the life of this world
crowded around.

178
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,110
Imagine your pain

179
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,620
as a white ball
of healing light.

180
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,020
It moves over your body,
healing you.

181
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,820
Now, keep this going.
Remember to breathe,

182
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,490
and step forward

183
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,120
through the back door
of the room.

184
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,670
Where does it lead?

185
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,290
To your cave.

186
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,670
Step forward
into your cave.

187
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,900
That's right.

188
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,540
You're going deeper
into your cave,

189
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:58,350
and you're going to find
your power animal.

190
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,880
Slide.

191
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,130
Every evening, I died...

192
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,230
and every evening,
I was born again.

193
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,970
Resurrected.

194
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,070
Bob loved me
because he thought

195
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,770
my testicles
were removed, too.

196
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,370
Being there...

197
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,310
pressed against his tits,

198
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,010
ready to cry.

199
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,990
This was my vacation.

200
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,760
And she ruined
everything.

201
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,230
This is cancer, right?

202
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,800
This chick Marla Singer

203
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:52,340
did not have
testicular cancer.

204
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,100
She was a liar.

205
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,800
She had no diseases at all.

206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,540
I had seen her
at Free and Clear

207
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,840
my blood parasites group
Thursdays.

208
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,640
Then at Hope, my bimonthly
sickle cell circle.

209
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,950
And again at Seize the Day,

210
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,610
my tuberculosis
Friday night.

211
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,480
Marla, the big tourist.

212
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,820
Her lie reflected my lie,

213
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,590
and suddenly,
I felt nothing.

214
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,260
I couldn't cry.

215
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,300
So once again,
I couldn't sleep.

216
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,650
Next group,
after guided meditation,

217
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,410
after we open
our heart chakras,

218
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,790
when it's time to hug,

219
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,910
I'm gonna grab
that little bitch

220
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:46,250
Marla Singer
and scream...

221
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,020
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist!

222
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,290
I need this!
Now get out!

223
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,830
I hadn't slept in 4 days.

224
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,630
Absolutely.
We'll just let that dry.

225
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,630
When you have insomnia,

226
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,170
you're never
really asleep...

227
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,230
and you're
never really awake.

228
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,540
To begin
tonight's communion,

229
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,410
Chloe would like
to say a few words.

230
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,140
Oh, yeah... Chloe.

231
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,650
Chloe looked the way

232
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,210
Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look

233
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,260
if you made it smile
and walk around the party

234
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,760
being extra nice
to everybody.

235
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,920
Well,
I'm still here,

236
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,900
but I don't know
for how long.

237
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,660
That's as much
certainty

238
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,430
as anyone
can give me.

239
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,730
But I've got
some good news.

240
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,790
I no longer
have

241
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,860
any fear
of death.

242
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:43,650
But I am in
a pretty lonely place.

243
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,210
No one will have sex
with me.

244
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,650
I'm so close to the end,

245
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,990
and all I want is to get
laid for the last time.

246
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,790
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

247
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,990
and lubricants
and amyl nitrate.

248
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,690
Chloe...

249
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,600
Everyone, let's
thank Chloe.

250
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,600
Now, let's...
ready ourself

251
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,300
for guided meditation.

252
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,970
You're standing at
the entrance of your cave.

253
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,920
You step inside your cave,
and you walk.

254
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,780
If I did
have a tumor...

255
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,380
I'd name it Marla.

256
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,050
Marla...

257
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,960
the little scratch
on the roof of your mouth

258
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,690
that would heal if only
you could stop tonguing it,

259
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,920
but you can't.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,520
...deeper
into your cave

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,160
as you walk.

262
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,530
You feel the healing energy
of this place

263
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,770
all around you.

264
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,800
Now find your power animal.

265
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,770
Slide.

266
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,710
OK. Now let's partner up.

267
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,020
Pick someone special
to you tonight.

268
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,060
Hey.

269
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,070
We need to talk.

270
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,070
Sure.

271
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,940
I'm onto you.

272
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,940
What?

273
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,570
Yeah. You're a faker.

274
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,980
You're not dying.

275
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,340
Sorry?

276
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,680
In the Tibetan philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense of the word,

277
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,410
I know we're all...
we're all dying, all right?

278
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,950
But you're not dying the way
Chloe back there is dying.

279
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,140
So?

280
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,020
So you're a tourist.

281
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,030
OK? I've seen you.
I saw you...

282
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,390
saw you at melanoma,

283
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,790
saw you
at tuberculosis,

284
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,800
I saw you at
testicular cancer.

285
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,530
I saw you
practicing this.

286
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,900
Practicing what?

287
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,030
Telling me off.

288
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,800
Is it going as well
as you hoped...

289
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,930
"RUPERT"?

290
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,340
I'll expose you.

291
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,400
Go ahead.
I'll expose you.

292
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,670
All right,
come together.

293
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,970
Let yourselves cry.

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,290
Oh, God, why
are you doing this?

295
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,880
It's cheaper than a movie,
and there's free coffee.

296
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,950
No, look...

297
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,930
this is important, OK?

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,960
These are my groups.

299
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,620
I've been coming here
for over a year.

300
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,830
Why do you do it?

301
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,930
I don't know.

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
When people think
you're dying,

303
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
man, they really,
really listen to you

304
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,300
instead of just...

305
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,900
Instead of just waiting
for their turn to speak.

306
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,570
Yeah.

307
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,120
Share yourself... completely.

308
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,720
OK, you don't want
to get into this.

309
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,340
It becomes an addiction.

310
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,410
Really?

311
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,650
I'm not kidding.

312
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,820
I can't cry if there's
another faker present,

313
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,980
and I need this.

314
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,960
So you got to find
somewhere else to go.

315
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,360
Candy stripe
a cancer ward.

316
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,300
It's not my problem.

317
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,230
Wait, wait, wait.

318
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,770
Whoa. Hold on.
I'll tell you.

319
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,460
We're gonna split up
the week, OK?

320
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,510
You take lymphoma
and tuberculosis...

321
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,700
You take
tuberculosis.

322
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,330
My smoking doesn't
go over at all.

323
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,840
OK. Good. Fine.

324
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,010
Testicular cancer should be
no contest, I think.

325
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,050
Well, technically,

326
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,850
I have more right to
be there than you.

327
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,980
You still have
your balls.

328
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:07,980
You're kidding.

329
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,850
I don't know. Am I?

330
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,480
No. No.

331
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,550
What do you want?

332
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,150
I'll take the parasites.

333
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,690
You can't have
both the parasites,

334
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,090
but why don't you take
the blood parasites...

335
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,390
I want brain parasites.

336
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,090
I'll take
the blood parasites,

337
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,890
but I'm gonna take the
organic brain dementia...

338
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,900
I want that.

339
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,270
You can't have
the whole brain.

340
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,930
So far you have 4.
I only have 2.

341
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,200
OK.

342
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,970
Take both the parasites.
They're yours.

343
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,810
Now we both have 3.

344
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,340
Hey, you left
half your clothes!

345
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,370
What, are you selling those?

346
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,200
Yes! I'm selling
some clothes.

347
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,330
So,

348
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,740
we each have 3.
That's 6.

349
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,040
What about the seventh day?
I want ascending bowel cancer.

350
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,540
The girl
had done her homework.

351
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,540
Thank you.

352
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,540
No. No, I...

353
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,810
I want bowel cancer.

354
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,640
That's your favorite, too?

355
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,950
Try to slip it by me, eh?

356
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,490
Look, we're gonna
split it, OK?

357
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,320
Take the first and third
Sunday of the month.

358
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,660
Deal.

359
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,160
Looks like
this is good-bye.

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,360
Well, let's not make a
big thing out of it, OK?

361
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,300
How's this for not
making a big thing?

362
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,170
Hey, Marla!

363
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,170
Marla!

364
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,800
May-Maybe we should
exchange numbers.

365
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,350
Should we?

366
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,380
W- We might want
to switch nights.

367
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,940
OK.

368
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,450
This is how I met
Marla Singer.

369
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,790
Marla's philosophy of life

370
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,960
was that she might die
at any moment.

371
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,730
The tragedy, she said,
was that she didn't.

372
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,960
It doesn't have
your name.

373
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,060
Who are you,

374
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,200
Cornelius,
Rupert,

375
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,600
Travis,

376
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,840
any of the
stupid names

377
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,100
you give each
night?

378
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,180
You wake up
at Seatac.

379
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,440
S.F.O...

380
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,540
L.A.X...

381
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,450
You wake up at O'Hare...

382
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,010
Dallas-Fort Worth...

383
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,060
B.W.I...

384
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,360
Pacific, mountain,
central...

385
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,990
Lose an hour,
gain an hour...

386
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,590
Check-in for that
flight doesn't begin

387
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,150
for another 2 hours,
sir.

388
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,260
This is your life, and it's
ending one minute at a time.

389
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,740
You wake up at Air Harbor
International...

390
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,740
the aircraft has
come to a complete stop.

391
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,470
If you wake up
at a different time,

392
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,510
in a different place,

393
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,670
could you wake up
as a different person?

394
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,850
Everywhere I travel,

395
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,380
tiny life...

396
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,280
single-serving sugar...

397
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,480
single-serving cream...

398
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,390
single pat of butter...

399
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,290
a microwave cordon-bleu
hobby kit.

400
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,330
Shampoo-conditioner combos.

401
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,630
Sample package mouthwash,
tiny bars of soap.

402
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,260
The people I meet
on each flight,

403
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,400
they're single-serving
friends.

404
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,270
Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together,

405
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,610
but that's all we get.

406
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,540
Welcome!

407
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,740
On
a long enough timeline,

408
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,340
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

409
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,480
I was a recall coordinator.

410
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,610
My job was
to apply the formula.

411
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,620
Here's where
the infant

412
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,950
went through
the windshield.

413
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,050
3 points.

414
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,460
A new car
built by my company

415
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,860
leaves somewhere traveling
at 60 miles per hour.

416
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,460
The rear differential
locks up.

417
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,520
The teenager's braces

418
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,130
are wrapped around
the back seat ashtray.

419
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,470
Might make
a good antismoking ad.

420
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,940
The car crashes and burns

421
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,630
with everyone
trapped inside.

422
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,200
Now, should we
initiate a recall?

423
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,470
The father
must've been huge.

424
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,710
You see
where the fat

425
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,910
has burned
to the seat,

426
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,510
the polyester shirt?

427
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,640
- Very modern art.
- Ha ha ha!

428
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,690
Take the number of
vehicles in the field, "A,"

429
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,380
multiply it by the probable
rate of failure, "B,"

430
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,480
then multiply the result

431
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,820
by the average out-of-court
settlement, "C."

432
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,660
"A" times "B" times "C"

433
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,200
equals "X."

434
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,200
If "X" is less
than the cost of a recall,

435
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,460
we don't do one.

436
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,770
Are there a lot

437
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,740
of these kinds
of accidents?

438
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,670
You wouldn't believe.

439
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,710
Which car company
do you work for?

440
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,440
A major one.

441
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,410
Every time the plane
banked too sharply

442
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,320
on takeoff or landing,

443
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,250
I prayed for a crash

444
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,790
or a midair collision.

445
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,830
Anything.

446
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,530
Life insurance
pays off triple

447
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,090
if you die
on a business trip.

448
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,940
"If you are seated in an
emergency exit row... "

449
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,240
Yeah...

450
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,870
"And you feel
you would be unable

451
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,380
or unwilling to
perform the duties

452
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,180
listed on
the safety card,

453
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,810
please ask
a flight attendant

454
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,820
to reseat you. "

455
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,750
It's a lot
of responsibility.

456
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,020
Wanna switch seats?

457
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,690
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man

458
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,590
for that particular job.

459
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,560
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet.

460
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,190
Mm-hmm.

461
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,200
The illusion of safety.

462
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,970
Yeah. I guess so.

463
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,560
You know why they put
oxygen masks on planes?

464
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,370
So you can breathe.

465
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,310
Oxygen gets you high.

466
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,780
In a catastrophic
emergency,

467
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,840
you're taking giant
panicked breaths.

468
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,510
Suddenly you become
euphoric, docile.

469
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,780
You accept your fate.

470
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,480
It's all right here.

471
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,290
Emergency
water landing...

472
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,790
600 miles an hour.

473
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,890
Blank faces,

474
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,660
calm as Hindu cows.

475
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,760
That's, um...

476
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,830
That's an interesting
theory.

477
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,800
What do you do?

478
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,310
What do you mean?

479
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,640
What do you do
for a living?

480
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,800
Why? So you can pretend
like you're interested?

481
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,710
OK.

482
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,620
You have a kind of
sick desperation

483
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,880
in your laugh.

484
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,250
We have
the exact same briefcase.

485
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,120
Soap.

486
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,130
Sorry?

487
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,930
I make
and I sell soap...

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,830
the yardstick
of civilization.

489
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,670
And this is
how I met...

490
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,430
"Tyler Durden. "

491
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,340
Did you know, if you
mixed equal parts

492
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,310
of gasoline and frozen
orange juice concentrate,

493
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,140
you can make napalm?

494
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,040
No, I did not know that.
Is that true?

495
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,210
That's right.

496
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,840
One can make all kinds
of explosives

497
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,750
using simple
household items.

498
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,880
Really?

499
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,610
If one were
so inclined.

500
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,020
Tyler, you are, by far,
the most interesting

501
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,660
"single-serving" friend
I've ever met.

502
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,530
See, obviously,

503
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,470
everything on a plane
is single-serving, even...

504
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,730
Oh, I get it.
It's very clever.

505
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,360
Thank you.

506
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,170
How's that working out
for you?

507
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,170
What?

508
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
Being clever.

509
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,840
Great.

510
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,850
Keep it up, then.

511
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,850
Right up.

512
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,180
Now a question
of etiquette.

513
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,380
As I pass,

514
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,850
do I give you the ass
or the crotch?

515
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,190
How I came
to live with Tyler is...

516
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,290
airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.

517
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,480
Was... Was it ticking?

518
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,880
Actually, throwers don't
worry about ticking,

519
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,440
'cause modern bombs
don't tick.

520
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,810
Sorry. "Throwers"?

521
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,040
Baggage handlers.

522
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,350
But when a suitcase
vibrates,

523
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,820
then the thrower's
gotta call the police.

524
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,550
My suitcase... was vibrating?

525
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,650
9 times out of 10,
it's an electric razor,

526
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,790
but every once
in a while...

527
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,830
it's a dildo.

528
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,000
Of course,
it's company policy

529
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,630
never to imply
ownership

530
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,000
in the event
of a dildo.

531
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,300
We have to use
the indefinite article

532
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,370
a dildo.

533
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,780
<i>Never your dildo.</i>

534
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,840
I don't own a...

535
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,450
I had everything
in that suitcase...

536
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,750
my CK shirts,

537
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,480
my DKNY shoes,

538
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,820
my AX ties.

539
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,780
Never mind.

540
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,160
Hey! That's my car!

541
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,210
Home was a condo
on the 15th floor

542
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,900
of a filing cabinet for widows
and young professionals.

543
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,670
The walls
were solid concrete.

544
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,540
A foot of concrete's
important

545
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,240
when your next-door neighbor
lets her hearing aid go

546
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,820
and has to watch game shows
at full volume...

547
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,650
Or when a volcanic blast

548
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,450
and debris that used to be your
furniture and personal effects

549
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,290
blows out of your
floor-to-ceiling windows

550
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,120
and sails flaming
into the night.

551
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,770
I suppose
these things happen.

552
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,780
There's nothing up there.

553
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,150
You can't go
into the unit.

554
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,550
Police orders.

555
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,230
Do you have somebody
you can call?

556
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,800
How embarrassing.

557
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,770
A house full of condiments
and no food.

558
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,180
The police would
later tell me

559
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,950
that the pilot light
might have gone out,

560
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,990
letting out just
a little bit of gas.

561
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,290
That gas could have
slowly filled the condo...

562
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,880
1,700 square feet
of high ceilings

563
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,760
for days and days.

564
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,630
Then the refrigerator's
compressor could've clicked on.

565
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,970
Yeah?

566
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,770
I can hear you
breathing, you...

567
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,120
If you asked me now,

568
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,020
I couldn't tell you
why I called him.

569
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,160
Hello?

570
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,240
Who's this?

571
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,540
Tyler?

572
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,100
Who is this?

573
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,910
Um, ahem, we met
on the airplane.

574
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,950
We had the same
suitcase.

575
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,210
Uh, the clever guy.

576
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,380
Oh, yeah. Right. OK?

577
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,250
I called
a second ago.

578
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,330
There was no answer.
I'm at a pay phone.

579
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,950
Yeah. I star-69ed you.

580
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,760
I never pick up my phone.

581
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,130
So, what's up, man?

582
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,400
Uh, well...

583
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,940
you're not gonna
believe this.

584
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,830
You know, man,
it could be worse.

585
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,240
A woman could
cut off your penis

586
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,400
while you're sleeping

587
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,780
and toss it
out the window

588
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,940
of a moving car.

589
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,570
There's always that.

590
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,280
I don't know,
it's just...

591
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,820
when you buy furniture,

592
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,290
you tell yourself,
that's it.

593
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,090
That's the last sofa
I'm gonna need.

594
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,420
Whatever else happens,

595
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,590
I've got that
sofa problem handled.

596
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,090
I had it all.

597
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,930
I had a stereo
that was very decent,

598
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,630
a wardrobe that was getting
very respectable.

599
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,970
I was close
to being complete.

600
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,470
Shit, man.
Now it's all gone.

601
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,630
All gone.

602
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,370
Hmm. All gone.

603
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,770
Do you know
what a duvet is?

604
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,940
Comforter.

605
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,740
It's a blanket.

606
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,840
Just a blanket.

607
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,780
Why do guys
like you and I

608
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,820
know what
a duvet is?

609
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,360
Is this essential
to our survival

610
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,950
in the hunter-gatherer
sense of the word?

611
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,320
No.

612
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,860
What are we, then?

613
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,830
We're, uh, you know,
consumers...

614
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,630
Right. We're consumers.

615
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,100
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

616
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,430
Murder, crime, poverty...

617
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,230
these things
don't concern me.

618
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,540
What concerns me are
celebrity magazines,

619
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,770
television
with 500 channels,

620
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,810
some guy's name
on my underwear.

621
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,480
Rogaine, Viagra,
Olestra.

622
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,520
Martha Stewart.

623
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,710
Fuck Martha Stewart.

624
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,520
<i>Martha's polishing the brass
on the Titanic.</i>

625
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,020
It's all going down, man.

626
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,530
So fuck off
with your sofa units

627
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,860
and Strinne green
stripe patterns.

628
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,400
I say,
never be complete.

629
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,020
I say,
stop being perfect.

630
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,660
I say, let's...
let's evolve.

631
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,600
Let the chips
fall where they may.

632
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,300
But that's me,
and I could be wrong.

633
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,430
Maybe it's a terrible
tragedy.

634
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,980
No. It's just stuff.

635
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,010
It's not a tragedy,
but...

636
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,170
Well, you did lose

637
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

638
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,920
Fuck. You're right.

639
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,380
No. I don't smoke.

640
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,590
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

641
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,220
What?

642
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,430
The things you own
end up owning you.

643
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,030
But do what
you like, man.

644
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,670
Oh, it's late.

645
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,510
Hey, thanks
for the beer.

646
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,840
Yeah, man.

647
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,810
I should find
a hotel.

648
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,820
Oh.

649
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,820
What?

650
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,820
A hotel.

651
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,820
Yeah.

652
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,480
Just ask, man.

653
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,920
What are you
talking about?

654
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,980
Oh, God.

655
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,530
3 pitchers of beer,

656
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,150
and you still
can't ask.

657
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,860
What?

658
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,730
You called me 'cause you
needed a place to stay.

659
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,560
Oh, hey, no, no, no.

660
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,640
Yes, you did.
So just ask.

661
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,970
Cut the foreplay
and just ask, man.

662
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,000
Would that
be a problem?

663
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,170
Is it a problem
for you to ask?

664
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,110
Can I stay
at your place?

665
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,120
Yeah.

666
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,580
Thanks.

667
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,790
I want you
to do me a favor.

668
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,950
Yeah, sure.

669
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,860
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

670
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,930
What?

671
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,800
I want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

672
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,340
Let me tell you
a little bit

673
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,840
about Tyler Durden.

674
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,410
Tyler was a night person.

675
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,640
While the rest of us
were sleeping,

676
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,770
he worked.

677
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,940
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

678
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,810
See, a movie doesn't come
all on one big reel.

679
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,040
It comes on a few.

680
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,620
So someone has to be there
to switch the projectors

681
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,910
at the exact moment
that one reel ends

682
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,250
and the next one begins.

683
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,320
If you look for it,
you can see these little dots

684
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,420
come into the upper right-hand
corner of the screen.

685
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,550
In the industry,

686
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,920
we call them
"cigarette burns. "

687
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,060
That's the cue
for a changeover.

688
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,600
He flips the projectors,

689
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,530
the movie keeps
right on going,

690
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,070
and nobody in the audience
has any idea.

691
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,610
Why would anyone want
this shit job?

692
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,610
Because it affords him other
interesting opportunities.

693
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,680
Like splicing single frames
of pornography

694
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,140
into family films.

695
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,310
So when the snooty cat
and the courageous dog

696
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,820
with the celebrity voices

697
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,880
meet for the first time
in reel 3,

698
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,180
that's when you'll
catch a flash

699
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,550
of Tyler's contribution
to the film.

700
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,950
Nobody knows
that they saw it,

701
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,090
but they did.

702
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,630
A nice big cock.

703
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,240
Even a hummingbird couldn't
catch Tyler at work.

704
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,180
Tyler also works sometimes
as a banquet waiter

705
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,580
at the luxurious
Pressman Hotel.

706
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,050
<i>He was the guerilla
terrorist</i>

707
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,460
of the food service
industry.

708
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,590
Do not watch.

709
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,150
I cannot go
when you watch.

710
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,790
Apart from seasoning
the lobster bisque,

711
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:03,300
he farted on meringues,

712
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,800
sneezed
on braised endive.

713
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,430
And as for the cream
of mushroom soup,

714
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,600
well...

715
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,110
Go ahead, tell them.

716
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,070
You get the idea.

717
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,840
What do you want me to do?
You just want me to hit you?

718
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,500
Come on. Do me
this one favor.

719
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,570
Why?

720
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,940
Why? I don't know why.
I don't know.

721
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,980
I've never been in a fight.
Have you?

722
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,480
No, but that's
a good thing.

723
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,610
No, it is not.

724
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,620
How much can you
know about yourself

725
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,120
if you've never
been in a fight?

726
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,480
I don't wanna die
without any scars.

727
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,420
So, come on, hit me
before I lose my nerve.

728
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:29,190
God, this is crazy.

729
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,850
So go crazy.
Let 'er rip.

730
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,760
Hey, I don't know
about this.

731
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,060
I don't, either,
but who gives a shit?

732
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,790
No one's watching.
What do you care?

733
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,130
Wait. This is crazy.
You want me to hit you?

734
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,140
That's right.

735
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,640
What, like,
in the face?

736
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,070
Surprise me.

737
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,340
This is so
fucking stupid.

738
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,720
Ohh!

739
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,620
Motherfucker!

740
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,630
You hit me
in the ear.

741
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,920
Well, Jesus,
I'm sorry.

742
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,830
Ow! Christ!

743
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,630
Why the ear, man?

744
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,760
Aw, I fucked it up.

745
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,830
No. That was perfect.

746
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,630
Ohh! Uhh!

747
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,910
Nah, it's all right.

748
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,540
That really hurts.

749
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,450
Right.

750
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,790
Hit me again.

751
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,960
No. You hit me.

752
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,050
Come on.

753
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,080
We should do this
again sometime.

754
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,320
Where's your car?

755
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,420
What car?

756
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,340
I don't know how
Tyler found that house,

757
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,540
but he said
he'd been there for a year.

758
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:29,670
It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.

759
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,980
Most of the windows
were boarded up.

760
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,310
There was no lock
on the front door

761
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,680
from when the police
or whoever kicked it in.

762
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,450
The stairs
were ready to collapse.

763
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,490
I didn't know if he owned it
or if he was squatting.

764
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,430
Neither would have
surprised me.

765
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,100
Yeah. That's you.

766
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,290
That's me.

767
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,160
That's the toilet.

768
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,170
Good?

769
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,170
Yeah. Thanks.

770
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,130
What a shithole.

771
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,640
Nothing worked.

772
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,510
Turning on one light

773
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,510
meant another light
in the house went out.

774
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,020
There were no neighbors,

775
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,110
just some warehouses
and a paper mill...

776
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,950
that fart smell of steam,

777
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,390
the hamster cage smell
of wood chips.

778
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,480
After work tomorrow,
we'll be...

779
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,530
Hey. What have
we here?

780
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,470
Hey, guys.

781
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,640
Hey.

782
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,840
It's cool.

783
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,900
Ohh!

784
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,350
Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.

785
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,920
By the end
of the first month,

786
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,720
I didn't miss TV.

787
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,100
I didn't even mind the warm,
stale refrigerator.

788
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,580
Can I be next?

789
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,940
All right, man.

790
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,250
Lose the tie.

791
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,090
Ooh!

792
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,750
At night,
Tyler and I were alone

793
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,090
for a half a mile
in every direction.

794
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,510
Rain trickled down
through the plaster

795
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,970
and the light fixtures.

796
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,870
Everything wooden
swelled and shrank.

797
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,880
Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.

798
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,280
The previous occupant had been
a bit of a shut-in.

799
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,050
Hey, man, what
are you reading?

800
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,210
Listen to this.

801
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,190
It's an article
written by an organ

802
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,690
in the first person.

803
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,320
"I am Jack's
medulla oblongata.

804
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,980
Without me, Jack
could not regulate

805
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,260
his heart rate,
blood pressure, or breathing. "

806
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,730
There's a whole series
of these.

807
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,160
<i>"I am Jill's nipples. "</i>

808
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,700
<i>"I am Jack's colon. "</i>

809
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,170
Yeah. "I get cancer.
I kill Jack. "

810
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,440
Whoa... Ohh!

811
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,770
After fighting,

812
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,040
everything else in your life
got the volume turned down.

813
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,580
What?

814
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,050
You could deal
with anything.

815
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,590
Have you finished
those reports?

816
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,590
If you could
fight anyone,

817
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,850
who would you fight?

818
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,400
I'd fight my boss,
probably.

819
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,800
Really?

820
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,460
Yeah. Why, who would
you fight?

821
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,700
I'd fight my dad.

822
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,570
I don't know my dad.

823
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,440
I mean, I know him,

824
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,340
but he left when I was,
like, 6 years old,

825
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:47,810
married this other woman
and had some other kids.

826
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,570
He, like, did this
every 6 years.

827
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,510
He goes to a new city
and starts a new family.

828
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,710
Fucker should open up
franchises.

829
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,780
My dad never
went to college,

830
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,290
so it was real
important that I go.

831
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,420
That sounds familiar.

832
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,620
So I graduate, I call
him up long distance.

833
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,100
I say, "Dad, now what?"
He says, "Get a job. "

834
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,100
Same here.

835
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,220
Now I'm 25.

836
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,630
I make
my yearly call again.

837
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,900
I say, "Dad, now what?"

838
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,400
He says, "I don't know.
Get married. "

839
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,410
Eh, I mean...

840
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,700
I can't get married.

841
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,540
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

842
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,100
We're a generation
of men

843
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,370
raised by women.

844
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,780
I'm wondering
if another woman

845
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,680
is really
the answer we need.

846
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,360
Most of the week,
we were Ozzie and Harriet.

847
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,930
But every Saturday night,

848
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,470
we were finding
something out.

849
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,700
We were finding out
more and more

850
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:46,830
that we were not alone.

851
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,740
Who turned
the lights off?

852
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,040
It used to be

853
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,800
that when I came home
angry or depressed,

854
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,540
I'd just clean my condo,

855
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,580
polish
my Scandinavian furniture.

856
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,010
I should've been looking
for a new condo.

857
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,810
I should've been haggling
with my insurance company.

858
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,720
I should've been upset about my
nice, neat flaming little shit.

859
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,280
But I wasn't.

860
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,760
The basic premise

861
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,620
of cyber-netting
any office

862
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,790
is make things
more efficient.

863
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,090
Monday mornings,
all I could do

864
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,260
was think about
next week.

865
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,500
Can I get the icon
in cornflower blue?

866
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,730
Absolutely.

867
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,070
Efficiency is priority
number one, people,

868
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,940
because waste
is a thief.

869
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,710
I showed this already
to my man, here.

870
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,080
You liked it,
didn't you?

871
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,780
You can swallow
a pint of blood

872
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:36,320
before you get sick.

873
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,160
It was right
in everyone's face.

874
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,390
Tyler and I
just made it visible.

875
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:44,690
It was on the tip
of everyone's tongue.

876
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,660
Tyler and I just
gave it a name.

877
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,080
Come on, people,
you gotta go home.

878
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,630
Turn off the jukebox.
Lock the back.

879
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,890
Every week,
Tyler gave the rules

880
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,260
that he and I decided.

881
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,850
Gentlemen, welcome
to Fight Club.

882
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,700
The first rule
of Fight Club is...

883
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,200
you do not talk
about Fight Club.

884
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:04,070
The second rule
of Fight Club is...

885
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,770
you do not talk
about Fight Club.

886
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,240
Third rule of Fight Club...

887
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:13,010
Someone yells "Stop!"
goes limp, taps out,

888
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,640
the fight is over.

889
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,840
Fourth rule...

890
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,250
Only 2 guys to a fight.

891
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,310
Fifth rule...

892
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,860
One fight at a time,
fellas.

893
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:25,590
Sixth rule...
No shirts, no shoes.

894
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,750
Seventh rule...

895
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,530
Fights will go on
as long as they have to.

896
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,940
And the eighth
and final rule...

897
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,500
If this is your first night
at Fight Club...

898
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,100
you have to fight.

899
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,650
This kid from work,
Ricky,

900
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,550
couldn't remember
whether you ordered pens

901
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,780
with blue ink or black...

902
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,350
Come on, man!

903
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,120
But Ricky was a god
for 10 minutes

904
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,790
when the trounced the maitre d'
of a local food court.

905
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,790
Sometimes,
all you could hear

906
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,090
were the flat, hard
packing sounds

907
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,260
over the yelling...

908
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,710
or the wet choke when
someone caught their breath

909
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,710
and sprayed...

910
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,900
Stop!

911
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,910
You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.

912
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,340
But Fight Club
only exists

913
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,680
in the hours between
when Fight Club starts

914
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,580
and when Fight Club ends.

915
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,750
Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,

916
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,720
I wouldn't be talking
to the same man.

917
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,310
Who you were
in Fight Club

918
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,520
is not who you were
in the rest of the world.

919
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:33,460
The guy who came to Fight Club
for the first time,

920
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,520
his ass
was a wad of cookie dough.

921
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,860
After a few weeks,

922
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:38,530
he was carved
out of wood.

923
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,630
If you could fight
any celebrity,

924
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,100
who would you fight?

925
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,230
Alive or dead?

926
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:45,800
It doesn't matter.
Who'd be tough?

927
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,710
Hemingway.

928
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,270
You?

929
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,470
Shatner.

930
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,740
I'd fight
William Shatner.

931
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,780
We all started
seeing things differently.

932
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,650
Everywhere we went,

933
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,850
we were sizing things up.

934
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,690
I felt sorry for guys
packed into gyms,

935
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,170
trying to look like
how Calvin Klein

936
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,100
or Tommy Hilfiger
said they should.

937
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,690
Is that what a man
looks like?

938
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,780
Ahh. Self-improvement
is masturbation.

939
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,210
And self-destruction.

940
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,800
Excuse me.

941
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,390
Kick his ass!

942
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,930
Hit him again, man!
Come on! Hit him!

943
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,410
Fight Club wasn't about
winning or losing.

944
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
It wasn't about words.

945
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,790
The hysterical shouting
was in tongues,

946
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,990
like in
a Pentecostal church.

947
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,370
- Is that it?
- Stop!

948
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,420
When the fight
was over,

949
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,440
nothing was solved,

950
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,990
but nothing mattered.

951
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,510
Hey, cool.

952
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,240
Afterwards,
we all felt saved.

953
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,410
Hey, man, how
about next week?

954
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,910
How about next month?

955
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,180
I hear you.

956
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,410
Irwin, you're
in the middle.

957
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,820
New guy. You, too.

958
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,720
Sometimes,
Tyler spoke for me.

959
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,760
He fell down
some stairs.

960
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,350
I fell down
some stairs.

961
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,860
Fight Club became the reason
to cut your hair short

962
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,270
or trim your fingernails.

963
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,810
OK. Any
historical figure.

964
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,740
I'd fight Gandhi.

965
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,240
Good answer.

966
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,370
How about you?

967
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:02,610
Lincoln.

968
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,040
Lincoln?

969
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:05,240
Mm.

970
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,750
Big guy, big reach.

971
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,010
Skinny guys fight
till they're burger.

972
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,490
Fuck.

973
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,420
Hey. Even the Mona Lisa's
falling apart.

974
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,790
Hello.

975
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:26,860
Where have
you been

976
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,800
the last 8 weeks?

977
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,140
Marla?

978
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,810
How'd you find me?

979
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:36,280
You left that
forwarding number.

980
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:39,180
I haven't seen you
in any support groups.

981
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,720
We split them up.

982
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,750
That was the idea,
remember?

983
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,580
Yeah, but you haven't
been going to yours.

984
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,350
How do you know?

985
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,150
I cheated.

986
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:51,020
I found a new one.

987
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,860
Really?

988
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:53,920
It's for men only.

989
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,590
Like the testicle thing?

990
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,790
Waaah!

991
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,370
Look, this is a bad time.

992
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,930
I've been going
to Debtors Anonymous.

993
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,100
You wanna see some
really fucked up people?

994
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,540
I'm just on my way out.

995
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,540
Me, too.

996
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:09,600
I've got a stomachful
of Xanax.

997
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,410
I took what was left
of a bottle.

998
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,540
It might have been
too much.

999
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,380
Just picture
watching Marla Singer

1000
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,350
throw herself around
her crummy apartment.

1001
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,460
But this isn't a
for-real suicide thing.

1002
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,890
This is probably one of
those cry-for-help things.

1003
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,390
This could
go on for hours.

1004
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:25,890
So you're staying in
tonight, then?

1005
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,400
Do you wanna wait

1006
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,830
and hear me
describe death?

1007
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,330
Do you wanna listen

1008
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,770
and see if my spirit
can use a phone?

1009
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:38,240
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1010
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,130
Tyler's door was closed.

1011
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,760
I'd been living here
for 2 months,

1012
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,330
and Tyler's door
was never closed.

1013
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,810
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

1014
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,820
Yeah, I can hardly believe
anything about last night.

1015
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,590
What... What are you
doing here?

1016
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,460
What?

1017
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,930
This is my house. What are
you doing in my house?

1018
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:43,440
Fuck you.

1019
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,950
Ha ha! Ohh...

1020
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,390
Oh, you got some fucked-up
friends, I'm tellin' you.

1021
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,120
Limber, though...

1022
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,490
silly coos.

1023
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,630
So, I come in last night.
Phone's off the hook.

1024
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,530
Guess who's
on the other end.

1025
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,760
I already knew the story
before he told it to me.

1026
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,710
Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?

1027
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:23,640
Do you think it'll
live up to its name?

1028
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,670
Or will it just be
a death... hairball?

1029
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,690
Prepare...
to evacuate soul.

1030
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,290
9...

1031
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,330
8...

1032
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,730
Now, how could Tyler,
of all people,

1033
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,930
think it was a bad thing that
Marla Singer was about to die?

1034
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,900
5...

1035
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,870
4...

1036
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,700
3... Oh, hang on.

1037
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,510
You got here fast.

1038
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,280
Did I call you?

1039
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,890
Huh?

1040
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,960
Hey.

1041
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,030
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

1042
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,530
Oh, don't worry.
It's not a threat to you.

1043
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,410
Oh, fuck.

1044
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,710
Somebody called the cops.

1045
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,220
Hey, where's 513?

1046
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:45,730
End of the hall.

1047
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,260
You know, the girl
who lives there

1048
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,700
used to be a charming,
lovely girl.

1049
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,960
She's lost faith
in herself.

1050
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,970
Miss Singer!

1051
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,830
She's a monster.

1052
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,570
You have every
reason to live!

1053
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,070
She's infectious
human waste!

1054
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,070
Miss Singer!

1055
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,110
<i>Good luck
trying to save her!</i>

1056
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,210
If I fall asleep,
I'm done for.

1057
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,560
You're gonna have to
keep me up...

1058
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,590
all... night.

1059
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,060
Un-fucking-believable.

1060
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,290
He was obviously
able to handle it.

1061
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:24,530
You know what I mean.
You fucked her.

1062
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,100
No, I didn't.

1063
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,640
Never?

1064
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,670
No.

1065
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,300
You're not into her,
are you?

1066
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,780
No! God, not at all.

1067
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:37,180
I am Jack's
raging bile duct.

1068
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,220
Are you sure?
You can tell me.

1069
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,780
Believe me, I'm sure.

1070
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,820
Put a gun
to my head

1071
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,790
and paint the walls
with my brains.

1072
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,050
That's good,
'cause she's a predator

1073
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,520
posing
as a house pet.

1074
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,580
Stay away
from that one.

1075
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,030
And the shit that came out
of this woman's mouth

1076
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,030
I ain't never heard.

1077
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,290
My God.

1078
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,230
I haven't been fucked
like that since grade school.

1079
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,320
Uhh!

1080
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,230
How could
Tyler not go for that?

1081
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,770
The night before last,
he was splicing

1082
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,640
sex organs
into Cinderella.

1083
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,770
Marla doesn't
need a lover.

1084
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,300
She needs
a fucking case worker.

1085
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,010
She needs a wash. And she's
in love with sport fuckin'.

1086
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,210
She invaded
my support groups.

1087
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,720
Now she'd invaded my home.

1088
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,720
Hey, hey.
Sit down.

1089
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,650
Now, listen. Can't have you
talking to her about me.

1090
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,060
Why would I talk
to her...

1091
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,100
You say anything about me
or what goes on in this house

1092
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,530
to her or to anybody,
we're done.

1093
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,790
Now, promise me.

1094
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:31,800
OK.

1095
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,800
You promise?

1096
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,740
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise.

1097
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,270
I just said
I promise.

1098
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,900
That's 3 times
you promised.

1099
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,280
If only I had wasted
a couple of minutes

1100
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,510
and gone to watch
Marla Singer die,

1101
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,110
none of this
would've happened.

1102
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,080
Unhh!
Unhh! Unhh!

1103
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,080
Unhh!

1104
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,620
Yeah! Oh!
Harder! Harder!

1105
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,660
Yeah! Ooh! Aah!

1106
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,350
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

1107
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,100
I could've moved
to another room...

1108
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,000
on the third floor, where
I might not have heard them.

1109
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,000
Oh, baby!

1110
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,730
But I didn't.

1111
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,450
Ohh!

1112
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,880
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1113
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:25,150
Ohh! Ohh! Aaahh!

1114
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,190
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1115
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,360
- Aah! Ohhh! Ohh!
- Ow!

1116
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,390
Ohh!

1117
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,090
What are you doin'?

1118
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,530
Just goin' to bed.

1119
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,000
Want to
finish her off?

1120
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,000
Uhh... oh!

1121
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,140
No.

1122
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,140
No, thank you.

1123
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:47,140
I found
the cigarettes.

1124
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,470
Who are you
talking to?

1125
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,600
Shut up.

1126
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,650
I became the calm little
center of the world.

1127
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,610
I was the Zen master.

1128
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,410
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1129
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,590
I wrote little haiku poems.

1130
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:06,390
I e-mailed them to everyone.

1131
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,860
Is that your blood?

1132
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:12,730
Some of it, yeah.

1133
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,290
You can't smoke
in here.

1134
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,800
Take the rest
of the day off.

1135
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,440
Come back Monday
with some clean clothes.

1136
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:21,910
Get yourself together.

1137
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,070
I got right in
everyone's hostile little face.

1138
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:27,450
Yes, these are bruises
from fighting.

1139
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,610
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

1140
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,150
I... am enlightened.

1141
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,550
You give up
the condo life...

1142
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,460
give up all your
flaming worldly possessions...

1143
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,220
go live
in a dilapidated house

1144
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,420
in a toxic waste
part of town...

1145
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,800
and you have to
come home to this.

1146
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:46,100
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1147
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,000
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

1148
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,710
Hello?

1149
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,110
Yes. This is
Detective Stern

1150
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,010
with the Arson Unit.

1151
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,310
We have
some new information

1152
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:04,750
about the incident
at your former condo.

1153
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,790
Yes?

1154
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:07,050
I don't know
if you're aware,

1155
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,490
but it seems that
someone sprayed freon

1156
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,820
into your front door
lock,

1157
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,230
then tapped it with a chisel
to shatter the cylinder.

1158
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,820
No, I wasn't aware
of that at all.

1159
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,800
I am Jack's cold sweat.

1160
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,990
Does this sound
strange to you?

1161
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,000
Uh, yes, sir.
Strange. Very strange.

1162
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,000
The dynamite...

1163
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,000
Dynamite?

1164
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:25,100
left a residue

1165
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,340
of ammonium oxylate
potassium chloride.

1166
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,410
Do you know
what this means?

1167
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,910
No. What
does it mean?

1168
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,880
It means it was
homemade.

1169
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,610
I'm sorry.
This is just coming

1170
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,240
as quite a shock
to me, sir.

1171
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,320
See, whoever set
this homemade dynamite

1172
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:41,880
could've blown out
your pilot light

1173
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:43,860
days before
the actual explosion.

1174
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,790
The gas was
just the detonator.

1175
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,260
Who would go and do
such a thing?

1176
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,560
I'll ask the questions.

1177
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,860
Tell him.
Tell him the liberator

1178
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,700
who destroyed my property
has realigned my perception.

1179
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,430
Excuse me.
Are you there?

1180
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,470
No, I am listening.
It's a little hard to know

1181
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,870
what to make
of all this.

1182
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:01,040
Have you recently made
enemies with anyone

1183
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,480
who might have access
to homemade dynamite?

1184
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,600
- Enemies?
- Reject the basic

1185
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,110
assumption of civilization,

1186
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,950
especially the importance
of material possessions.

1187
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:09,520
Son, this is serious.

1188
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:10,920
Yes, I know
it's serious.

1189
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:11,920
I mean that.

1190
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:13,580
Yes,
it's very serious.

1191
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,630
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

1192
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:18,920
That condo was my life.

1193
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,960
OK? I loved every stick
of furniture in that place.

1194
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,970
That was not just
a bunch of stuff

1195
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,090
that got destroyed.

1196
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,230
It was me!

1197
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,770
I'd like
to thank the Academy.

1198
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,470
Is this not
a good time for you?

1199
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,300
Just tell him
you fuckin' did it.

1200
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,340
Shhh!

1201
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,880
Tell him you
blew it all up.

1202
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,540
That's what
he wants to hear.

1203
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:38,840
Are you still there?

1204
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,540
Wait. Are you saying
that I'm a suspect?

1205
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,180
No, no. I may need to talk
to you a little further,

1206
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,220
so how about you just lettin' me
know if you're gonna leave town?

1207
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,380
OK?

1208
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:48,550
OK.

1209
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,320
Except
for their humping,

1210
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,130
Tyler and Marla were
never in the same room.

1211
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,260
My parents pulled this
exact same act for years.

1212
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:03,170
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

1213
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,170
You slip one on
when you meet a stranger.

1214
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,680
You... dance
all night.

1215
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,840
Then you
throw it away.

1216
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,380
The condom, I mean.
Not the stranger.

1217
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,220
What?

1218
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:23,850
I got this dress
at a thrift store for $1.00.

1219
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,860
It was worth
every penny.

1220
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,830
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

1221
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:32,360
Someone loved it...
intensely

1222
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,870
for one day...

1223
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,430
then tossed it.

1224
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,700
Like a Christmas tree...

1225
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,240
so special...

1226
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:46,040
then... bam...

1227
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,710
it's on the side
of the road...

1228
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,010
tinsel still
clinging to it...

1229
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,860
like a sex crime victim...

1230
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,450
underwear inside out...

1231
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,390
bound with electrical tape.

1232
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,690
Well, then it suits you.

1233
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,760
You can borrow it
sometime.

1234
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:13,500
Get rid of her.

1235
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:15,970
Why can't you
get rid of her?

1236
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,210
Don't mention me.

1237
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,800
I'm 6 years old again,

1238
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,110
passing messages
between parents.

1239
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:26,680
I really think it's time
you got out of here.

1240
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,950
Don't worry.
I'm leaving.

1241
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,990
Not that we don't love
your little visits.

1242
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,490
You are such
a nut case.

1243
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,030
I can't even begin
to keep up.

1244
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,830
Gotta get off

1245
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,990
Thanks. Bye.

1246
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:43,940
Gotta get off
this merry-go-round

1247
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,070
Gotta get on where

1248
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,720
You kids.

1249
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,950
Wh... Why do you still
waste time with her?

1250
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,780
I'll say this
about Marla...

1251
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,950
at least she's tryin'
to hit bottom.

1252
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,430
What, and I'm not?

1253
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,550
Stickin' feathers
up your butt

1254
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,650
does not make you
a chicken.

1255
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,500
What are we doin' tonight?

1256
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,190
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1257
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,270
We make soap.

1258
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,460
Really.

1259
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,600
To make soap,
first we render fat.

1260
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,990
The salt balance
has to be just right,

1261
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,790
so the best fat for making
soap comes from humans.

1262
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,090
Wait.
What is this place?

1263
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:45,660
A liposuction clinic.

1264
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,030
Aha! Pay dirt.

1265
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,270
The richest, creamiest fat
in the world.

1266
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:00,780
Fat of the land.

1267
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,120
Come on.

1268
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,220
Oh, God! Oh!

1269
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,930
Get another one.
Unhh!

1270
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,630
As the fat renders, the tallows
float to the surface.

1271
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,470
Like in Boy Scouts.

1272
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,910
I can imagine you
as a Boy Scout.

1273
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:30,970
Keep stirrin'.

1274
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,250
Once the tallow hardens,

1275
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,550
we skim off
a layer of glycerin.

1276
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,920
If you were to add nitric
acid, you got nitroglycerin.

1277
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:41,250
If you were then to add
sodium nitrate

1278
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,950
and a dash of sawdust,
you got dynamite.

1279
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:45,820
Yeah, with enough soap,

1280
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,190
we could blow up
just about anything.

1281
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,200
Tyler was full
of useful information.

1282
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,700
Now, ancient peoples found
that clothes got cleaner

1283
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,570
when they washed them at a
certain point in the river.

1284
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,160
- You know why?
- No.

1285
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,400
Human sacrifices
were once made

1286
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:02,840
on the hills
above this river.

1287
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,070
Bodies burned. Water seeped
into the wood and ashes

1288
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,810
to create lye.

1289
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,180
This is lye,
the crucial ingredient.

1290
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,980
Once it mixed with the
melted fat of bodies,

1291
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,540
a thick, white,
soapy discharge

1292
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,990
crept into the river.
May I see your hand, please?

1293
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:24,330
What is this?

1294
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,830
This... is chemical burn.

1295
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:26,990
Uh... Aah! Aah!

1296
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,930
It'll hurt more than
you've ever been burned,

1297
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,600
and you will have
a scar.

1298
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:34,040
If meditation worked for
cancer, it could work for this.

1299
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,870
Stay with the pain.
Don't shove to center.

1300
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:37,610
No, no! Oh, God!

1301
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,050
Look at your hand.

1302
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,480
The first soap was made
from the ashes of heroes,

1303
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,110
like the first monkey
shot into space.

1304
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,850
Without pain,
without sacrifice,

1305
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,220
we would have nothin'.

1306
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:48,220
I tried not to think of the
the words "sear" or "flesh. "

1307
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:49,820
Stop it!
This is your pain.

1308
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:51,450
This is your burning
hand. It's right here.

1309
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,620
I'm going to my cave.

1310
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,220
I'm going to my cave
and find my power animal.

1311
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,360
No! Don't deal with it the way
those dead people do!

1312
01:02:57,430 --> 01:02:58,370
Come on!

1313
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,630
I get the point!
OK! Please!

1314
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:01,260
No. What you're feeling
is premature enlightenment.

1315
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,810
This is the greatest moment
of your life, man,

1316
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,900
and you're off
somewhere...

1317
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:12,450
Shut up.

1318
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,980
Our fathers were
our models for God.

1319
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,310
If our fathers bailed,

1320
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,180
what does that
tell you about God?

1321
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,190
No, no.

1322
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,950
Listen to me.

1323
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,960
You have to consider
the possibility

1324
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,080
that God
does not like you,

1325
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,220
He never wanted you.

1326
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:27,690
In all probability,
He hates you.

1327
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,590
This is not the worst thing
that can happen.

1328
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,330
We don't need Him.

1329
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,420
We don't! I agree!

1330
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,300
Fuck damnation, man.
Fuck redemption.

1331
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,800
We are God's
unwanted children?

1332
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:36,960
So be it!

1333
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,240
Listen! You can run
water over your hand

1334
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,640
to make it worse, or...
look at me...

1335
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,940
or you can use vinegar
to neutralize the burn.

1336
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,240
Please let me have
some! Please!

1337
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,940
First you have to
give up.

1338
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:51,320
First you have to know,
not fear,

1339
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,290
know that someday
you're gonna die.

1340
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,120
You don't know
how this feels!

1341
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,690
It's only after
we've lost everything

1342
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:04,790
that we're free
to do anything.

1343
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,700
OK.

1344
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,210
Congratulations.

1345
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:27,150
You're one step closer
to hitting bottom.

1346
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,790
Tyler sold his soap
to department stores

1347
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,590
at $20 a bar.

1348
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,030
<i>God knows
what they charged.</i>

1349
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,790
This is
the best soap.

1350
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:39,360
Why, thank you,
Suzie.

1351
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,930
It was beautiful.

1352
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,400
We were selling rich women

1353
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:44,800
their own fat asses
back to them.

1354
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,900
He was wearing
his yellow tie.

1355
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,570
I didn't even wear a tie
to work anymore.

1356
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,240
"The first rule
of Fight Club

1357
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:54,010
is you don't talk
about Fight Club"?

1358
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,780
I'm half asleep again.

1359
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:57,680
I must've left the original
in the copy machine.

1360
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,220
"The second rule of Fight Club... "
Is this yours?

1361
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,020
Huh?

1362
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,580
Pretend you're me.

1363
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,420
Make a managerial
decision.

1364
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,120
You find this.
What would you do?

1365
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,800
Well, I gotta tell ya...

1366
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,360
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

1367
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,140
Because the person
who wrote that...

1368
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:21,940
is dangerous.

1369
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,910
And this buttoned-down,
oxford-cloth psycho

1370
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,540
might just snap

1371
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,210
and then stalk
from office to office

1372
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,980
with an Armilade AR-10
carbine gas-powered

1373
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,610
semi-automatic weapon,

1374
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,560
pumping round
after round

1375
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,530
into colleagues
and coworkers.

1376
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:43,230
This might be someone
you've known for years...

1377
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,670
someone very...
very... close to you.

1378
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,830
Tyler's words
coming out of my mouth.

1379
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,370
And I used to be
such a nice guy.

1380
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,740
Maybe you shouldn't bring me
every little piece of trash

1381
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:57,410
you happen to pick up.

1382
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,080
Liability.

1383
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:03,850
My tit's gonna rot off.

1384
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:07,350
Will you excuse me?
I need to take this.

1385
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,060
What're you talking about?

1386
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,330
I need you to check and see
if there's a lump in my breast.

1387
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,030
Go to a hospital.

1388
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,300
I can't afford to throw money
away on a doctor.

1389
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,570
I don't know
about this, Marla.

1390
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,340
Please?

1391
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,140
She didn't
call Tyler.

1392
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,370
I'm neutral in her book.

1393
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,710
That's nice.

1394
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,340
Taking food
to Mrs...

1395
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,780
Hannaburr,
Mrs. Raines?

1396
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,220
Who are they...
exactly?

1397
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,050
Tragically,
they're dead.

1398
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:41,920
I'm alive,
and I'm in poverty.

1399
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,960
You want any?

1400
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:43,960
No. No.

1401
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:45,320
I got one for you.

1402
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,760
Thanks for the thought.

1403
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,930
What happened
to your hand?

1404
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,160
Uh... nothin'.

1405
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,200
Right there.

1406
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,200
Uhh.

1407
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:57,940
Feel anything?

1408
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,940
No.

1409
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:00,270
Well, make sure.

1410
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,270
OK, I'm...
I'm pretty sure.

1411
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,400
You feel nothing.

1412
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,510
No. Nothing.

1413
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,450
Well, that's a relief.

1414
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,780
Thank you.

1415
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,790
Uh, um...
no problem.

1416
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:16,980
I wish I could
return the favor.

1417
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,150
There's not a lot of breast cancer
in the men in my family.

1418
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:20,660
Could check
your prostate.

1419
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,720
I think I'm OK.

1420
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,730
Well, thanks, anyway.

1421
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,030
Are we done?

1422
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,470
Yeah, we're done.
See you... around.

1423
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,760
Cornelius?

1424
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:54,830
Cornelius!

1425
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,630
It's me...

1426
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,070
Bob!

1427
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,530
Hey... Bob.

1428
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,100
Hey. Uhh!

1429
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:05,370
We all thought
you were dead.

1430
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,600
No, no. Still here.

1431
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,610
<i>How are you, Bob?</i>

1432
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,510
Better than I've ever been
in my whole life.

1433
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,280
Really. You still
remaining men together?

1434
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,440
No, no. I got somethin'
so much better now.

1435
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:18,010
Really.
What is it?

1436
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,220
Well...

1437
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:23,380
first rule is...

1438
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,290
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

1439
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:27,790
And the second rule is,

1440
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,590
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

1441
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,260
And the third
rule is...

1442
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,730
Bob. Bob.
I'm a member.

1443
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,330
Look at my face, Bob.

1444
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,640
That's fuckin'...
That's fuckin' great.

1445
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:42,640
I've... I've
never seen you there.

1446
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,440
I go Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

1447
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:46,480
I go Saturday.

1448
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:47,810
Congratulations.

1449
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,980
Yeah. Hey,
to both of us, right?

1450
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,780
Have you heard about the guy
that invented this thing?

1451
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,480
Well, uh,
yeah, actually. I...

1452
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,750
I hear all kinds
of things.

1453
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:01,090
Supposedly... he was born
in a mental institution.

1454
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,760
And he sleeps only
one hour a night.

1455
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,170
He's a great man.

1456
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,170
Oh...

1457
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,500
Do you know
about Tyler Durden?

1458
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,070
Ha ha ha!

1459
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,790
Take him down!

1460
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,230
I didn't hurt you,
did I?

1461
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,860
Actually, you did.

1462
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,560
Thank you for this.

1463
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,760
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

1464
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,770
Fight Club.

1465
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,740
Bob. Bob. Bob. Bob.

1466
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,400
This was mine
and Tyler's gift...

1467
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,670
our gift to the world.

1468
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,580
Look around. Look around.

1469
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:54,550
I see a lot
of new faces.

1470
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,550
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1471
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,610
Shut up!

1472
01:09:57,890 --> 01:09:59,750
Which means a lot of you

1473
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,720
have been breaking
the first 2 rules of Fight Club.

1474
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:12,260
Man, I see in Fight Club

1475
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,200
the strongest and smartest
men who've ever lived.

1476
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,760
I see all this
potential.

1477
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,140
And I see squandering.

1478
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:21,600
God damn it.

1479
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,610
An entire generation
pumping gas...

1480
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,170
waiting tables...

1481
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,180
slaves with white collars.

1482
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:34,080
Advertising has its taste
in cars and clothes...

1483
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,390
working jobs we hate so we can
buy shit we don't need.

1484
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,790
We're the middle children
of history, man.

1485
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,300
No purpose or place.

1486
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:49,800
We have no Great War...
no Great Depression.

1487
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,140
Our Great War's
a spiritual war.

1488
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,440
Our Great Depression
is our lives.

1489
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,820
We've all been raised
on television

1490
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,820
to believe that one day
we'd all be millionaires

1491
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:08,350
and movie gods
and rock stars.

1492
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,150
But we won't.

1493
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,130
We're slowly learning
that fact.

1494
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:16,090
And we're very,
very pissed off.

1495
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:17,100
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1496
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,470
First rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about...

1497
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,720
Who are you?

1498
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,080
Who am I?

1499
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,220
Yeah.

1500
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,750
There's a sign
in the front

1501
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,890
that says
"Lou's Tavern. "

1502
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,220
I'm fuckin' Lou.

1503
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,930
Who the fuck are you?

1504
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,990
Tyler Durden.

1505
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:52,000
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1506
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,040
We have a deal
worked out with Irvin.

1507
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,130
Irvin?

1508
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:57,740
Irvin's at home with
a broken collarbone.

1509
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,410
He don't own
this place.

1510
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,410
I do.

1511
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,510
How much money is he
gettin' for this?

1512
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,880
<i>There is no money.</i>

1513
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,520
- Really. Ain't that somethin'?
- Free to all.

1514
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,460
It is, actually.

1515
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:13,020
Look, stupid fuck...

1516
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,560
I want everybody
outta here right now.

1517
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,900
Hey. You should
join our club.

1518
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,670
Did you hear
what I just said?

1519
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,470
You and your friend.

1520
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,340
Oomp!

1521
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:25,470
Uhh!

1522
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,440
You hear me now?!

1523
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,170
No, I didn't quite
catch that, Lou.

1524
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:32,310
Ooh!

1525
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:33,320
Pfft!

1526
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:35,980
Ohhh...

1527
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,320
Still not gettin' it.

1528
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:42,190
Aah! OK, OK, OK.
I got it.

1529
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,690
I got it. I got it.
Shit, I lost it.

1530
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,320
Ooh!

1531
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,520
Back! All of you!

1532
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,690
Everybody back.

1533
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1534
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,970
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1535
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,070
Aw, Lou...

1536
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,140
Come on, man.

1537
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,740
We really like
this place.

1538
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,580
Ohh!

1539
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:13,780
Ohhh...

1540
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,850
- That's right, Lou, get it...
- Shut the fuck up!

1541
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,660
Oh, yeah!

1542
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,290
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha ha!

1543
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,560
Ho ho ho ha ha ha!

1544
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:24,930
Think that's
fuckin' funny?!

1545
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,970
Ho ho, ho!
Ha ha ha ha!

1546
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,030
Ha ha ha ha...
Ohh! Ho ho ho!

1547
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,510
Fuckin' guys are loony,
I'm tellin' ya.

1548
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,770
Unbelievable. Aah!

1549
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:45,880
You don't know
where I've been, Lou.

1550
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,620
- Oh, my God!
- Ha ha ha!

1551
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:50,560
You don't know where
I've been! Ha ha!

1552
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:52,960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1553
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:55,260
Lou! Please let us
keep it, Lou!

1554
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,800
Please, Lou!

1555
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,300
Fuckin' use the basement!
Christ!

1556
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:02,300
I want your word, Lou!
I want your word!

1557
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,310
On my mother's honor.

1558
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:06,970
Uhh!

1559
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,480
Lou!

1560
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,210
Aaahhh!

1561
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,580
Thanks, Lou.

1562
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,580
You, too, big guy.

1563
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:24,480
See you next week.

1564
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,110
This week...
each one of you...

1565
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,270
has a homework
assignment.

1566
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,580
You're gonna go out.

1567
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,080
You're gonna start a fight
with a total stranger.

1568
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:54,050
You're gonna
start a fight.

1569
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,590
And you're
gonna lose.

1570
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,320
Excellent choice,
sir.

1571
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:05,060
Hey! Watch out,
jackass!

1572
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:06,230
Come on!

1573
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,900
Now, this is not
as easy as it sounds.

1574
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,640
I'm thinkin'
you really... What?!

1575
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,180
Son of a bitch!

1576
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,140
Most people...
normal people...

1577
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,270
do just about anything
to avoid a fight.

1578
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,110
Excuse me.
You sprayed me with your hose.

1579
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,350
Like that?

1580
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,820
That's not necessary.

1581
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,720
Dave!
Go call 911!

1582
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:30,420
Aaaahhh!

1583
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,700
Stop it!

1584
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,300
Sorry.

1585
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:40,230
What did...
Come here!

1586
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,430
Leave me alone!
You crazy?

1587
01:15:42,510 --> 01:15:43,470
Uhh!

1588
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:45,900
Unhh! Uhh!

1589
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,040
Bastard!

1590
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,270
We need to talk.

1591
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,920
OK.

1592
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,720
Where to begin?

1593
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,260
With your constant
absenteeism?

1594
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:08,390
With your unpresentable
appearance?

1595
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,860
You're up for review.

1596
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:13,160
I am Jack's...
complete lack of surprise.

1597
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,170
What?

1598
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,200
Let's pretend.

1599
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:17,100
You're the Department
of Transportation.

1600
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,140
OK?

1601
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,870
Someone informs you
that this company

1602
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:23,940
installs front seat
mounting brackets

1603
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,040
that never pass
collision tests...

1604
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:29,520
brake linings that fail
after a thousand miles,

1605
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:31,750
and fuel injectors
that explode

1606
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,580
and burn people alive.

1607
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,020
What then?

1608
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,360
Are you threatening me?

1609
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,390
No...

1610
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,260
Get the fuck outta here.
You're fired.

1611
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,030
I have a better solution.

1612
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,560
You keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant.

1613
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,370
And in exchange
for my salary,

1614
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,270
my job will be never
to tell people

1615
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,540
these things
that I know.

1616
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,600
I don't even have to come
into the office.

1617
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,170
I can do this job
from home.

1618
01:16:57,980 --> 01:16:59,910
Who... Who the fuck
do you think you are,

1619
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,680
you crazy little shit?

1620
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:08,320
Security?

1621
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,380
I am
Jack's smirking revenge.

1622
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,650
Ohh!

1623
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,590
Ohh!

1624
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,030
Ahh... ahh...

1625
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,430
What the hell
are you doing?

1626
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,940
Ohh... that hurt.

1627
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,880
Why would you do that?

1628
01:17:36,990 --> 01:17:38,250
Oh, my God.

1629
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,980
No! Please stop!

1630
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:45,130
Uhh! Uh... uhh!

1631
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:51,360
What are you doing?

1632
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,560
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1633
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,300
For some reason,
I thought of my first fight

1634
01:17:57,370 --> 01:17:58,740
with Tyler.

1635
01:17:58,810 --> 01:17:59,740
No!

1636
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,130
Under and behind
and inside,

1637
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,360
everything this man
took for granted...

1638
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,800
something horrible
had been growing.

1639
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,130
Now, look.

1640
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,510
Give me the paychecks
like I asked,

1641
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:38,910
and you won't
ever see me again.

1642
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:42,450
And right then, at our most
excellent moment together...

1643
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:46,910
Oh... thank God.

1644
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,850
Please don't hit me
again. Please...

1645
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,120
Telephone, computer,
fax machine,

1646
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:55,390
52 weekly paychecks, and
48 airline flight coupons.

1647
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,860
We now had
corporate sponsorship.

1648
01:18:57,930 --> 01:19:00,200
This is how Tyler and I were
able to have Fight Club

1649
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:01,700
every night of the week.

1650
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,930
Now nobody was the center
of Fight Club

1651
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,010
except the 2 men fighting.

1652
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:13,100
The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.

1653
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:17,250
Tyler was now involved
in a class-action lawsuit

1654
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,810
with the Pressman Hotel over
the urine content of their soup.

1655
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,660
I am Jack's wasted life.

1656
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,300
Yeah! Yeah! Ha ha!
Yeah!

1657
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:37,740
There you are, sir.

1658
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,670
Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.

1659
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,370
He handed them out
in sealed envelopes.

1660
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,150
Did you know
there's a Fight Club

1661
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:28,160
up in Delaware City?

1662
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,160
Yeah, I heard.

1663
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,920
There's one
in Penn's Grove, too.

1664
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,260
Bob even found one
up in Newcastle.

1665
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,270
Yeah. Did you start
that one?

1666
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,730
No. I thought you did.

1667
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,060
Nah.

1668
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,070
Pff!

1669
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,380
Stop for a second.

1670
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:32,890
Hey, what are we doing?

1671
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,890
Turn around.

1672
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,390
What are we doing?

1673
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,390
Homework assignment.

1674
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,720
What kind of
homework assignment?

1675
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,060
Human sacrifice.

1676
01:21:39,130 --> 01:21:40,250
Hey, is that a gun?

1677
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,730
Please. Please tell me
that's not a gun.

1678
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,730
It's a gun.

1679
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:43,730
What are you doing?

1680
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,730
Meet me in the back.

1681
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,270
Hey, don't fuck around.

1682
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:47,530
Meet me in the back.

1683
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,730
On a long enough
time line,

1684
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:52,210
the survival rate
for everyone drops to zero.

1685
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:55,300
What are you doing?
Come on.

1686
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,710
Hands behind your back.

1687
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,710
God.

1688
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,870
Give me your wallet.

1689
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,480
Raymond K. Hessel,

1690
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:04,540
1320 Southeast Banning,
apartment A.

1691
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,950
Small, cramped basement
apartment, Raymond?

1692
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,050
How did you know?

1693
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,750
Because they give
shitty basement apartments

1694
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,760
letters instead of numbers.

1695
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,290
Raymond...

1696
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,760
you're going to die.

1697
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,300
Oh, my God, no...

1698
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:16,560
Is that your mom and dad?

1699
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,120
Mom and dad are going
to have to call up

1700
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:19,200
kindly Dr. So-And-So

1701
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,670
to pick up
your dental records.

1702
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:21,930
You want to know why?

1703
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,730
Because there's going to be
nothing left of your face.

1704
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,570
Aw, come on.

1705
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,080
An expired community college
student I.D.

1706
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:29,580
What'd you study, Raymond?

1707
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:31,200
S- S-S-Stuff.

1708
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,680
Stuff?

1709
01:22:32,750 --> 01:22:34,880
Were the midterms hard?

1710
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:37,350
I asked you
what you studied.

1711
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,550
Biology, mostly.

1712
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:39,750
Why?

1713
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,720
I... I don't know.

1714
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,190
What did you want to be,
Raymond K. Hessel?

1715
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,790
The question, Raymond,

1716
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:52,340
was what did you
want to be?

1717
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,230
Answer him,
Raymond! Jesus!

1718
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,700
Veterinarian!
Veterinarian!

1719
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,830
Animals.

1720
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:58,840
Yeah, animal s-s-s...

1721
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:59,930
Stuff.
Yeah, I got that.

1722
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,070
That means you have to
get more schooling.

1723
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:02,580
Too much school.

1724
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:04,010
Would you rather be dead?

1725
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,010
No...

1726
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,310
Would you
rather die, here,

1727
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:07,820
on your knees,

1728
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:09,680
in the back
of a convenience store?

1729
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,310
No... No, please...

1730
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,650
no...

1731
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,480
I'm keeping your license.

1732
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,320
Gonna check in on you.

1733
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,330
I know where you live.

1734
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,370
If you're not on your way
to becoming a veterinarian

1735
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:27,060
in 6 weeks,
you will be dead.

1736
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,770
Now run on home.

1737
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,840
Run, Forrest, run!

1738
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,850
I feel ill.

1739
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,120
Imagine how he feels.

1740
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,120
Come on,
this isn't funny!

1741
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,620
That wasn't funny.

1742
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,720
What the fuck
was the point of that?

1743
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:51,230
Tomorrow will be
the most beautiful day

1744
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:52,730
of Raymond K. Hessel's life.

1745
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,230
His breakfast
will taste better

1746
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,200
than any meal you and I
have ever tasted.

1747
01:23:58,730 --> 01:24:01,290
You had to
give it to him.

1748
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:02,730
Come on.

1749
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:03,770
He had a plan.

1750
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,770
And it started
to make sense

1751
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,210
in a Tyler sort of way.

1752
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,240
No fear.

1753
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,280
No distractions.

1754
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,710
The ability to let
that which does not matter

1755
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:15,750
truly slide.

1756
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,520
You're not your job.

1757
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:35,030
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1758
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:39,540
You're not
the car you drive.

1759
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:42,200
You're not the contents
of your wallet.

1760
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,700
You're not
your fuckin' khakis.

1761
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,320
You're the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1762
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,330
I'll be out of your way
in a sec.

1763
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,860
You don't have to go.

1764
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,060
Whatever.

1765
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:12,070
No, I mean, uh...

1766
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,340
It's OK.

1767
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:25,690
Are you still going
to groups?

1768
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:26,850
Yeah.

1769
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,860
Chloe's dead.

1770
01:25:30,930 --> 01:25:33,620
Ah, Chloe.

1771
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,860
When did that happen?

1772
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,330
Do you care?

1773
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:39,700
I don't know.

1774
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,960
I haven't thought
about it in a while.

1775
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,300
Yeah, well...

1776
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,500
I think it was
a smart move on her part.

1777
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,980
Hey, listen, uh...

1778
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:53,710
what are you getting
out of all this?

1779
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:54,940
What?

1780
01:25:56,190 --> 01:25:57,620
I mean, all this.

1781
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,120
Why do you keep...

1782
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,660
Is this
making you happy?

1783
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,320
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1784
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,230
I don't know.
I don't understand.

1785
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,230
Why does
a weaker person

1786
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,730
need to latch on to
a strong person?

1787
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,060
What is that?

1788
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:17,260
Well, what do you
get out of it?

1789
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,140
No... It's... It's not
the same thing at all.

1790
01:26:21,210 --> 01:26:23,080
I mean, we're... It's
totally different with us.

1791
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:24,240
We're... We're...

1792
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,340
Us?

1793
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,250
What do you mean by "us"?

1794
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,050
I'm sorry,
do you hear this?

1795
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,140
Hear what?

1796
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:32,190
You're not hearing
all that noise?

1797
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:33,190
Just... Hold on a second.

1798
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,380
No, wait.
What were you saying?

1799
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:36,150
Don't change the subject.
I want to talk about this.

1800
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:37,920
You're not talking
about me, are you?

1801
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:39,820
No. What?

1802
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,690
That day you came over
to my place to play doctor...

1803
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,320
what was going on there?

1804
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,370
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

1805
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:45,900
Nothing. Nothing.

1806
01:26:45,970 --> 01:26:47,030
I don't think so.

1807
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,330
Come on,
what do you want?

1808
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,700
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1809
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,530
Look at me.

1810
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:53,040
What is that?

1811
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:54,700
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1812
01:26:54,780 --> 01:26:55,710
Oh, my God.

1813
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,800
Who did this?

1814
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:57,810
A person.

1815
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:58,870
Guy or girl?

1816
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,940
What do you care
if it's a guy or a girl?

1817
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,070
What do you care
if I ask?

1818
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:03,310
This is none of your
business. Leave me alone.

1819
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:04,320
You're afraid to say it.

1820
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:05,320
I am not afraid to say.
Let me go.

1821
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:06,410
No! Talk to me.

1822
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,720
- No!
- Let go of me. Leave me alone.

1823
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:10,450
This conversation...

1824
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,860
is over.

1825
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:17,360
I just can't win
with you, can I?

1826
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:28,140
Hey, this is getting
a little old.

1827
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,940
What is... What is all this?

1828
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:33,410
What do you think?

1829
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:37,940
Hey, why do we need
bunk beds?

1830
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,950
Hey.

1831
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,620
Too young.

1832
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,250
Sorry.

1833
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:51,530
What's all that?

1834
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:54,160
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1835
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,700
Old, too old.
Fat, too fat.

1836
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:56,740
Applicant?

1837
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,670
If the applicant
then waits for 3 days

1838
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,670
without food, shelter
or encouragement,

1839
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,180
he may then enter
and begin his training.

1840
01:28:03,250 --> 01:28:04,800
Training for what?

1841
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:11,890
You think
this is a game?

1842
01:28:11,950 --> 01:28:13,890
You're too young
to train here.

1843
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,890
End of story.
Quit wasting our time.

1844
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,360
Get the fuck
out of here.

1845
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,360
Bad news, friend.

1846
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:26,470
It's not gonna happen.

1847
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:29,470
I'm sorry if there was
a misunderstanding.

1848
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,510
It's not the end
of the world.

1849
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,040
Just go away.

1850
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:36,010
Go.

1851
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,670
You're trespassing,

1852
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,680
and I will have to
call the police.

1853
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,950
Don't you look at me.

1854
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:46,780
Do you think you're
ever getting in this house?

1855
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,290
You're never getting in
this fucking house.

1856
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,190
Never. Now get the fuck
off the porch.

1857
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:51,730
Get off the porch!

1858
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:53,230
Sooner or later,

1859
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,320
we all became what Tyler
wanted us to be.

1860
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,230
I'm gonna go inside and
I'm gonna get a shovel.

1861
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:06,710
You got 2 black shirts?

1862
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:07,710
Sir.

1863
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,210
2 pair of black pants?

1864
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,210
Yes, sir.

1865
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:11,210
One pair of black boots?

1866
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,210
Sir.

1867
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,210
2 pair of black socks?

1868
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,210
Sir.

1869
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,210
One black jacket?

1870
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,220
Sir.

1871
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,380
$300 personal burial money?

1872
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:18,510
Yes, sir.

1873
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,020
All right.

1874
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,360
You're too old,
fat man.

1875
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,030
Your tits
are too big.

1876
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,510
Get the fuck
off my porch.

1877
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:48,520
Bob. Bob.

1878
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:05,130
Like a monkey

1879
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,260
ready to be shot
into space.

1880
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,860
Space monkey.

1881
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:13,140
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1882
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,980
You are too
fucking old, fatty!

1883
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,680
And you.

1884
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:25,340
You're too fucking...

1885
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,750
blond!

1886
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:29,220
Get out of here,
the both of you!

1887
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:31,590
And so it went.

1888
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,590
Listen up, maggots.

1889
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,150
You are not special.

1890
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:39,530
You are not
a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1891
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,100
You are the same
decaying organic matter

1892
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:43,760
as everything else.

1893
01:30:43,870 --> 01:30:46,170
Tyler
built himself an army.

1894
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:50,210
We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1895
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,870
We are all part of
the same compost heap.

1896
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,950
Why was Tyler Durden
building an army?

1897
01:30:59,050 --> 01:31:00,650
To what purpose?

1898
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:02,480
For what greater good?

1899
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,760
In Tyler we trusted.

1900
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:17,370
No, when he was like, "You are
not your job," I was like...

1901
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:18,960
Yeah!

1902
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,300
Hey, what's all this?

1903
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,040
OK!

1904
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:29,140
Go on in
and celebrate.

1905
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,650
What are we celebrating?

1906
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,690
Go on.

1907
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,160
Hey.

1908
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,660
Let me get that
for you.

1909
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,340
Investigators are
on the scene right now.

1910
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:54,640
Hold on. Police Commissioner
Jacobs has just arrived.

1911
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,710
Commissioner, Commissioner,
could you please tell us

1912
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:59,400
what you think
has happened here?

1913
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:00,980
We believe
this is one of many

1914
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:03,180
recent acts of vandalism
around the city

1915
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:06,250
somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.

1916
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:10,380
We'll be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.

1917
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:12,930
That was Police Commissioner
Jacobs, who just arrived

1918
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:14,860
on the scene here
of a 4-alarm fire

1919
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,560
that broke out
about an hour ago.

1920
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,630
She's hot.

1921
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:19,220
Live from the Parker
Morris Building,

1922
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,130
Lauren Sanchez.
Back to you in the studio.

1923
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:22,830
Yeah!

1924
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:24,430
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Yeah.

1925
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,130
Holy shit.

1926
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,140
Yeah!

1927
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:31,970
- Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

1928
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,310
Hoo hoo hoo!

1929
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,970
What the fuck
did you guys do?

1930
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,380
...how the blaze started,

1931
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,180
but arson investigators
are on the premises...

1932
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:47,330
Sir, the first rule
of Project Mayhem

1933
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,730
is you do not
ask questions, sir.

1934
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:57,640
The victory
in the war against crime

1935
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,730
will not come overnight.

1936
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:01,970
It will take dedication
and commitment,

1937
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:04,480
and most of all,
cooperation.

1938
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,070
The streets are safer now.

1939
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,380
There is hope
in the inner city.

1940
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,470
However, this is only
the beginning.

1941
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:11,550
I gotta take a piss.

1942
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,050
These are the first steps

1943
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:15,650
in a long journey.

1944
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,060
That is why we have
created Project Hope...

1945
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,250
Bob.

1946
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:22,300
"Helping others with
prevention and enforcement. "

1947
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:25,090
Project Hope will be
a joint effort

1948
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,830
between the police
and community leaders.

1949
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,530
It will be
a powerful new weapon

1950
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,400
in the war against crime.

1951
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,000
Haahhhh!

1952
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:20,280
Wrap it around the top of
his hacky sack, Bob.

1953
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,750
Yeah. His balls
are ice cold.

1954
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,560
Hi.

1955
01:34:24,660 --> 01:34:27,150
You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1956
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:28,250
You're gonna publicly state

1957
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,130
that there is no
underground group, or...

1958
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,960
these guys are gonna
take your balls.

1959
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:35,160
<i>They're gonna send one
to the New York Times,</i>

1960
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:38,210
<i>one to the L.A. Times
press release style.</i>

1961
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:39,470
Look...

1962
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:41,040
the people you are after

1963
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,040
are the people
you depend on.

1964
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,140
We cook your meals.
We haul your trash.

1965
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,300
We connect your calls.

1966
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,900
We drive your ambulances.

1967
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:51,350
We guard you
while you sleep.

1968
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:57,260
Do not fuck with us.

1969
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:06,900
Fooled ya.

1970
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,350
Bob, you're on this one.

1971
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:26,780
Let's go.

1972
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:31,090
I am Jack's
inflamed sense of rejection.

1973
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:32,090
Hey!

1974
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,970
Yeah!

1975
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,540
I felt like putting
a bullet between the eyes

1976
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:27,310
of every panda that wouldn't
screw to save its species.

1977
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,240
I wanted to open
the dump valves

1978
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,650
on oil tankers and smother
all those French beaches

1979
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,310
I'd never see.

1980
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,990
I wanted to breathe smoke.

1981
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,910
Where'd you go,
psycho boy?

1982
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,990
I felt like destroying
something beautiful.

1983
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:12,050
Get him to
a fuckin' hospital.

1984
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:13,060
Yeah.

1985
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:26,030
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.

1986
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,840
Airport parking,
long term.

1987
01:37:29,010 --> 01:37:30,810
After you, Mr. Durden.

1988
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:33,870
After you.

1989
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:53,770
Something on your mind,
dear?

1990
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,890
No.

1991
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,100
All right, yeah.

1992
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:58,260
Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1993
01:37:58,340 --> 01:37:59,570
First rule of Project Mayhem

1994
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:01,440
is you do not ask questions.

1995
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:02,440
What are you talking about?

1996
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:03,740
Why didn't you include me
in the beginning?

1997
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:05,340
Fight Club
was the beginning.

1998
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:07,040
Now it's moved
out of the basement,

1999
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,550
it's called
Project Mayhem.

2000
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:10,080
You and I started
Fight Club together.

2001
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:11,450
Do you remember that?

2002
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,490
It's as much mine
as it is yours, you know.

2003
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,780
Is this about
you and me?

2004
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,590
Yeah. I thought we were
doing this together.

2005
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:17,820
You're missing the point.

2006
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:20,020
This does not
belong to us.

2007
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:21,320
We are not special.

2008
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:22,620
Fuck that.
You should've told me.

2009
01:38:24,700 --> 01:38:25,830
Hey, Tyler!

2010
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,330
Goddamn it, Tyler!

2011
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:32,070
What do you want?!
Statement of purpose?

2012
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,200
Should I e-mail you?

2013
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:34,760
Should I put this
on your action item list?

2014
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:36,330
You decide your own
level of involvement!

2015
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,110
I will! I want to know
certain things first.

2016
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:40,810
The first rule
of Project Mayhem...

2017
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:41,810
Shut up!

2018
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,010
I want to know
what you're thinking.

2019
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,050
Fuck what you know.

2020
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,350
You need to forget
about what you know.

2021
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,350
That's your problem.

2022
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,680
Forget about what
you think you know

2023
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,550
about life,
about friendship,

2024
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:52,990
and especially
about you and me.

2025
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:54,030
What?

2026
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,360
What is that supposed
to mean? What...

2027
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,630
What are you doing?

2028
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:05,530
Guys, what do you wish
you'd done before you die?

2029
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,630
Paint a self-portrait.

2030
01:39:06,710 --> 01:39:07,640
Build a house.

2031
01:39:07,710 --> 01:39:09,180
And you?

2032
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,800
I don't know.
Get in the right lane.

2033
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:13,470
I have to know the answer
to this question.

2034
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:14,610
If you were to die
right now,

2035
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,620
how would you feel
about your life?

2036
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:17,710
I don't know!

2037
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:18,980
I wouldn't feel anything
good about my life.

2038
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:20,350
Is that what you want
to hear me say? Fine.

2039
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,010
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

2040
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,890
Stop fucking around!

2041
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,260
Tyler!

2042
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,450
Jesus Christ!

2043
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,660
Goddamn it!

2044
01:39:30,730 --> 01:39:32,290
Goddamn it!
Fuck you!

2045
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:33,730
Fuck Fight Club.

2046
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:36,460
Fuck Marla.
I'm sick of all your shit.

2047
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:40,270
OK.

2048
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:41,870
Quit screwing around.
Take the wheel.

2049
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:42,880
Look at you.

2050
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:43,880
Take the wheel!

2051
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,710
Look at you!
You're fuckin' pathetic!

2052
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,340
Why? Why?
What are you talking about?

2053
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:50,870
Why do you think
I blew up your condo?

2054
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:53,080
What?

2055
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:55,180
Hitting bottom
isn't a weekend retreat.

2056
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:57,090
It's not
a goddamn seminar.

2057
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,090
Stop trying
to control everything

2058
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:00,750
and just let go.

2059
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,530
Let go!

2060
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,330
All right. Fine.

2061
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,440
Fine.

2062
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,660
I'd never been
in a car accident.

2063
01:41:10,730 --> 01:41:13,670
This must have been what
all those people felt like

2064
01:41:13,740 --> 01:41:17,670
before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.

2065
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:19,040
Goddamn.

2066
01:41:19,110 --> 01:41:20,540
Huh?

2067
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:22,600
Ha ha ha ha ha hahh!

2068
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:25,370
We just had
a near-life experience.

2069
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:33,120
In the world I see,

2070
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,950
you're stalking elk through
the damp canyon forest,

2071
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:38,550
around the ruins
of Rockefeller Center.

2072
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,630
You'll wear leather clothes

2073
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:45,630
that will last you
the rest of your life.

2074
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,140
You'll climb the vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

2075
01:41:50,610 --> 01:41:52,540
And when you look down,

2076
01:41:52,610 --> 01:41:55,540
you'll see tiny figures
pounding corn,

2077
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,050
laying strips of venison
on the empty carpool lane

2078
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:01,050
of some abandoned
superhighway.

2079
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,430
Feel better, champ.

2080
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,610
And then...

2081
01:42:35,680 --> 01:42:37,120
Tyler?

2082
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,710
Tyler was gone.

2083
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:48,760
Was I asleep?

2084
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,730
Had I slept?

2085
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,230
You are not
a beautiful

2086
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,730
unique snowflake,
do you understand me?

2087
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,740
The house had become
a living thing,

2088
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:00,240
wet inside
from so many people

2089
01:43:00,310 --> 01:43:01,640
sweating and breathing.

2090
01:43:01,710 --> 01:43:03,640
We are all from
the same compost.

2091
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:05,910
So many people moving,
the house moved.

2092
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,650
Planet Tyler.

2093
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,650
I had to hug the walls.

2094
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,280
Trapped inside this
clockwork of space monkeys.

2095
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:16,790
You can't be
smoking in here.

2096
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:19,590
Do you know how much ether
we have in this fucking house?

2097
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,990
Cooking, working,
and sleeping in teams.

2098
01:43:24,570 --> 01:43:26,290
Hang on a second.

2099
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,880
It's under control, sir.

2100
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,260
Where is Tyler?

2101
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:55,290
Sir, the first rule of
Project Mayhem is you do not...

2102
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,300
Right, uh... OK.

2103
01:43:59,770 --> 01:44:02,130
I'm all alone.

2104
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,140
My father dumped me.

2105
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:05,640
Tyler dumped me.

2106
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:08,900
I am Jack's broken heart.

2107
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:15,110
What comes next
in Project Mayhem,

2108
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:16,650
only Tyler knows.

2109
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:20,180
The second rule is
you do not ask questions.

2110
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,090
Get the fuck
away from me.

2111
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:25,650
Get the fuck
away from me!

2112
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:28,130
Who are all these people?

2113
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:35,490
Paper Street Soap Company.

2114
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,830
Can I come in?

2115
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,500
He's not here.

2116
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:46,770
What?

2117
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:51,420
Tyler isn't here.

2118
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:53,980
Tyler went away.

2119
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,320
Tyler's gone.

2120
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:27,110
Lay him down!

2121
01:45:27,190 --> 01:45:28,490
Gunshot wounds
comin' through!

2122
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,990
Clear some fucking room!

2123
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:33,360
What happened?!
What happened?!

2124
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:34,990
We were on assignment.
We were supposed to kill

2125
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,530
2 birds with one stone.

2126
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,690
Destroy a piece
of corporate art...

2127
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,290
Operation Latte Thunder,
go.

2128
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:46,140
and trash a franchise
coffee bar.

2129
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:53,910
We had it all
worked out, sir.

2130
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,090
It went smooth
until...

2131
01:46:04,190 --> 01:46:06,390
Police! Freeze!

2132
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,050
Until what?

2133
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:09,150
They shot Bob.

2134
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,060
They shot him
in the head.

2135
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,100
Those fuckin' pigs!

2136
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,540
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

2137
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:19,570
- Oh, God.
- Son of a...

2138
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:22,770
Those motherfuckers!

2139
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,610
You morons.

2140
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:26,980
You're running around
in ski masks,

2141
01:46:27,050 --> 01:46:28,140
trying
to blow things up.

2142
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,440
What did you think
was gonna happen?!

2143
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:34,520
OK, quick,

2144
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:35,990
we gotta get rid
of the evidence.

2145
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:36,990
We gotta get rid
of this body!

2146
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,030
Bury him.

2147
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,520
What?

2148
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,530
Take him
to the garden

2149
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:41,720
and bury him.

2150
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:43,800
Come on,
people!

2151
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:44,800
Let's go!

2152
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:45,990
Hey, get
the fuck off!

2153
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,030
Get away from him!

2154
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:48,590
What are you
talking about?

2155
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:50,070
This isn't a fucking
piece of evidence,

2156
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:51,370
this is a person!

2157
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,370
He's a friend
of mine,

2158
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,500
and you're not
gonna bury him

2159
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,570
in the fucking garden.

2160
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:57,640
He was killed serving
Project Mayhem, sir.

2161
01:46:57,780 --> 01:46:58,870
This is Bob.

2162
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:01,380
But sir, in... in
Project Mayhem

2163
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:03,010
we have no names.

2164
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:04,080
No, you
listen to me.

2165
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:06,020
This is a man,
and he has a name.

2166
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:08,650
And it's
Robert Paulson, OK?

2167
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,150
Robert
Paulson?

2168
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,780
He's a man
and he's dead now

2169
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:12,880
because of us,
all right?

2170
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:14,150
Do you understand that?

2171
01:47:14,260 --> 01:47:16,460
I understand.

2172
01:47:19,070 --> 01:47:20,330
In death,

2173
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,200
a member of
Project Mayhem

2174
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:23,860
has a name.

2175
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:27,300
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2176
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:34,340
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2177
01:47:34,450 --> 01:47:37,440
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2178
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:38,920
Come on, guys,
please, stop it.

2179
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:40,420
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2180
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:43,120
His name
is Robert Paulson.

2181
01:47:43,220 --> 01:47:45,220
Shut up!

2182
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:46,290
This is all
over with!

2183
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,160
His name
is Robert Paulson.

2184
01:47:48,230 --> 01:47:50,290
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2185
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,960
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2186
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:55,540
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2187
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:57,970
His name is
Robert Paulson...

2188
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:22,900
Tyler?

2189
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,230
No, this is
Detective Stern

2190
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:25,260
at the Arson Unit.

2191
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:26,360
I need to see you
in my office...

2192
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:32,430
I went to
all the cities

2193
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:34,370
on Tyler's
used ticket stubs,

2194
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:35,370
barhopping.

2195
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:37,740
I didn't know
how or why,

2196
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:39,400
but I could look
at 50 different bars

2197
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:41,110
and somehow
I just knew.

2198
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:42,180
I'm looking
for Tyler Durden.

2199
01:48:42,250 --> 01:48:44,980
It's very important
that I talk to him.

2200
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:46,580
I wish
I could help you.

2201
01:48:47,690 --> 01:48:48,620
Sir.

2202
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:56,390
Every city
I went to...

2203
01:48:58,130 --> 01:49:00,430
as soon as I set foot
off the plane,

2204
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,730
I knew a Fight Club
was close.

2205
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,500
Hey! Hey!

2206
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:07,200
Taxi!

2207
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:08,740
Look at my face.
I'm a member.

2208
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:09,970
Now, I just
need to know

2209
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,050
if you've seen Tyler.

2210
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:14,210
I'm not exposed
to...

2211
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,840
speak any such
information to you,

2212
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:17,610
nor would I, even if
I had said information

2213
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,550
you want at this
juncture, be able.

2214
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:23,480
You're a moron.

2215
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:24,960
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

2216
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:28,450
Tyler had
been busy.

2217
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,290
Setting up franchises
all over the country.

2218
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,570
Was I asleep?

2219
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:38,540
Had I slept?

2220
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,200
Is Tyler
my bad dream,

2221
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:42,240
or am I Tyler's?

2222
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,670
We've just
heard the stories.

2223
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:44,970
What kind
of stories?

2224
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,510
Like, nobody knows
what he looks like.

2225
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:47,550
He has facial

2226
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:48,550
reconstructive
surgery

2227
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,670
every 3 years.

2228
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:52,120
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

2229
01:49:52,190 --> 01:49:54,590
Is it true about
Fight Club in Miami?

2230
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:57,020
Is Mr. Durden
building an army?

2231
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:58,650
I was living
in a state

2232
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,920
of perpetual
dj vu.

2233
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:02,550
Everywhere I went,

2234
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:05,100
I felt I'd already
been there.

2235
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:09,100
It was like following
an invisible man.

2236
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:11,230
The smell
of dried blood,

2237
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:15,600
dirty, bare footprints
circling each other,

2238
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:19,110
that aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.

2239
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,870
The feel of a floor
still warm

2240
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,510
from the fight
the night before.

2241
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:26,550
I was always just
one step behind Tyler.

2242
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:31,090
His name
is Robert Paulson.

2243
01:50:31,190 --> 01:50:33,520
His name is
Robert Paulson.

2244
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:34,530
His...

2245
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,700
Welcome back,
sir.

2246
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,390
How have
you been?

2247
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,300
Do you know me?

2248
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:46,870
Is this a test,
sir?

2249
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:48,870
No, this
is not a test.

2250
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:52,640
You were in here
last Thursday.

2251
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,180
Thursday?

2252
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:55,180
You were
standing

2253
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:56,580
exactly where
you are now,

2254
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:59,350
asking how good
security is.

2255
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:00,750
It's tight
as a drum, sir.

2256
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,660
Who do you
think I am?

2257
01:51:05,730 --> 01:51:08,290
Are you sure this
isn't a test?

2258
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,330
No, this is
not a test.

2259
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:13,770
You're Mr. Durden.

2260
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:16,360
You're the one
who gave me this.

2261
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:18,730
Please return
your seat backs

2262
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,470
to their full, upright
and locked position.

2263
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:33,320
Yeah?

2264
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:34,320
Marla, it's me.

2265
01:51:34,360 --> 01:51:35,580
Have we ever
done it?

2266
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:36,590
Done what?

2267
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:37,750
Have we ever
had sex?

2268
01:51:37,860 --> 01:51:40,020
What kind of stupid
question is that?

2269
01:51:40,130 --> 01:51:41,460
Is it stupid because
the answer's yes,

2270
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:42,500
or because
the answer's no?

2271
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:44,050
Is this a trick?

2272
01:51:44,130 --> 01:51:45,360
No, Marla,
I need to know...

2273
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:46,560
You mean you want
to know if I think

2274
01:51:46,670 --> 01:51:49,160
we were just having sex
or making love?

2275
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,330
We did make love.

2276
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:52,560
Is that what
you're calling it?

2277
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:53,940
Just answer
the question,

2278
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:54,940
Marla, please!

2279
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,010
Did we do it
or not?

2280
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,580
You fuck me,
then snub me.

2281
01:51:57,680 --> 01:51:58,670
You love me,
you hate me.

2282
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:00,210
You show me
a sensitive side,

2283
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,710
then you turn into
a total asshole.

2284
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:02,800
Is that a pretty
accurate description

2285
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:04,320
of our relationship,
Tyler?

2286
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:07,010
We have just lost
cabin pressure.

2287
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,050
What did you
just say?

2288
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,110
What is wrong
with you?

2289
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,420
What did you call
me? Say my name!

2290
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:12,490
Tyler Durden.
Tyler Durden,

2291
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,190
you fucking freak.
What's going on?

2292
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:15,230
I'm coming over.

2293
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:16,260
No, wait, Marla,
I'm not there...

2294
01:52:18,470 --> 01:52:20,260
You broke
your promise.

2295
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:21,300
Jesus, Tyler.

2296
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,030
You fuckin' talked
to her about me.

2297
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:24,800
Tyler, what the fuck
is going on here?

2298
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:26,570
I asked you
for one thing,

2299
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:28,330
one simple thing.

2300
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,600
Why do people
think that I'm you?

2301
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:32,470
Answer me!

2302
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,220
Sit.

2303
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:41,520
Now answer me.

2304
01:52:41,590 --> 01:52:43,080
Why do people think
that I'm you?

2305
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:45,360
I think you know.

2306
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:46,950
No, I don't.

2307
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:48,120
Yes, you do.

2308
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:50,820
Why would anyone possibly
confuse you with me?

2309
01:52:52,030 --> 01:52:54,730
Uh... I...
I don't know.

2310
01:52:58,570 --> 01:52:59,940
You got it.

2311
01:53:00,010 --> 01:53:01,440
No.

2312
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,480
Do not
fuck with us.

2313
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,750
Say it.

2314
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:06,970
Because...

2315
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:09,470
Say it.

2316
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:13,290
Because we're
the same person.

2317
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:15,480
That's right.

2318
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,720
We are the all-singing,
all dancing...

2319
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:19,320
I don't
understand this.

2320
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:20,330
You were looking
for a way

2321
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:21,520
to change your life.

2322
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,890
You could not do this
on your own.

2323
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:25,860
All the ways you wish
you could be,

2324
01:53:25,930 --> 01:53:27,490
that's me.

2325
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:29,830
I look like
you wanna look,

2326
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,100
I fuck like
you wanna fuck,

2327
01:53:31,170 --> 01:53:32,500
I am smart,
capable,

2328
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:34,730
and most importantly,
I am free

2329
01:53:34,810 --> 01:53:36,330
in all the ways
that you are not.

2330
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:37,400
Oh, no.

2331
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:38,410
Tyler's not here.

2332
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,410
Tyler went away.

2333
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,410
- Tyler's gone.
- What?

2334
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,910
This is
impossible.

2335
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,540
- No.
- This is crazy.

2336
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:44,950
People do it
every day.

2337
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:46,350
They talk
to themselves.

2338
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,580
They see themselves
as they'd like to be.

2339
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:50,590
They don't have
the courage you have,

2340
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:51,850
to just
run with it.

2341
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:57,560
Naturally, you're still
wrestling with it,

2342
01:53:57,630 --> 01:53:59,120
so sometimes
you're still you.

2343
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,960
We should do this
again sometime.

2344
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:03,900
Other times, you imagine
yourself watching me.

2345
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:05,300
If this is your first
night at Fight Club,

2346
01:54:05,370 --> 01:54:06,460
you have to fight.

2347
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,870
Little by little,

2348
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,270
you're just letting
yourself become...

2349
01:54:11,310 --> 01:54:13,710
Tyler Durden.

2350
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:14,800
You are not
your job,

2351
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,580
or how much money
you have in the bank!

2352
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:17,810
No, you have
a house.

2353
01:54:17,890 --> 01:54:19,080
Rented in your name.

2354
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:21,090
You have jobs, you
have a whole life.

2355
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:22,750
You have night jobs
because you can't sleep.

2356
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,650
Or you stay up
and make soap.

2357
01:54:24,730 --> 01:54:26,280
Marla... You're
fucking Marla, Tyler.

2358
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:28,290
Uh, technically,
you're fucking Marla.

2359
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,660
But it's
all the same to her.

2360
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,490
Oh, my God.

2361
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:36,560
Now you see
our dilemma.

2362
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:38,660
She knows too much.

2363
01:54:39,810 --> 01:54:40,860
I think we're going
to have to talk

2364
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:44,170
about how this might
compromise our goals.

2365
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:47,270
Wh... What are
you saying?

2366
01:54:47,310 --> 01:54:48,980
This is...
This is bullshit.

2367
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:50,540
This is bullshit.

2368
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:51,580
I'm not listening
to this.

2369
01:54:51,650 --> 01:54:52,580
You are insane.

2370
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:54,480
No, you're insane.

2371
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:57,080
And we simply do not
have time for this crap.

2372
01:54:59,660 --> 01:55:01,530
It's called
a changeover.

2373
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:03,120
The movie goes on,

2374
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:04,630
and nobody
in the audience

2375
01:55:04,700 --> 01:55:06,290
has any idea.

2376
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,210
Sir!

2377
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:21,580
Are you checking out?

2378
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:22,840
Yeah, uh,
b- bill me.

2379
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,580
I need you to
initial this list

2380
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:25,740
of phone calls,
please.

2381
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:30,920
When were
these made?

2382
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:32,220
It says
right there, sir,

2383
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:33,820
between 2:00 and 3:30
this morning.

2384
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:35,260
No, I w...

2385
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:40,220
Have I been
going to bed

2386
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:41,530
earlier
every night?

2387
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,630
Have I been
sleeping later?

2388
01:55:45,610 --> 01:55:48,630
Have I been Tyler
longer and longer?

2389
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:53,110
Is anybody here?

2390
01:55:56,180 --> 01:55:59,020
Dj vu
all over again.

2391
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,020
Yeah, with
enough soap,

2392
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:02,490
we could blow up
just about anything.

2393
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:07,680
Oh, my God.

2394
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,760
1888.

2395
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:13,090
I'm sorry,
who am I calling?

2396
01:56:13,170 --> 01:56:15,130
1888 Franklin.
This is Maintenance.

2397
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,670
Hello?

2398
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:21,610
1888 Franklin Street?

2399
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:24,770
Yes.
Can I help you?

2400
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:28,710
Hello?

2401
01:56:28,780 --> 01:56:29,910
Yeah, yeah.

2402
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:31,280
Uh, I need to talk
to your supervisor

2403
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,290
right away.

2404
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:33,290
Speaking.

2405
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:34,290
OK, listen to me.

2406
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,520
I think something
really terrible

2407
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:36,560
is about to happen
at your building.

2408
01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:37,610
You have got...

2409
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:38,920
It's under
control, sir.

2410
01:56:40,290 --> 01:56:41,280
Excuse me?

2411
01:56:41,330 --> 01:56:42,890
Don't worry
about us, sir.

2412
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,400
We're solid.

2413
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,330
2160.

2414
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:58,270
Marla!
Marla!

2415
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:00,370
Hey... Fuck! Wait!

2416
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:03,140
Wait, I gotta
talk to you!

2417
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:04,380
Marla, Marla!

2418
01:57:04,450 --> 01:57:05,540
Your whacked-out
bald freaks

2419
01:57:05,620 --> 01:57:07,090
hit me with
a fucking broom!

2420
01:57:07,150 --> 01:57:08,820
They almost
broke my arm!

2421
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,520
They were burning their
fingertips with lye,

2422
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:11,580
the stink was
unbelievable.

2423
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:12,590
Look... Look,
listen,

2424
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:13,590
it's gonna take
a tremendous act

2425
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:14,590
of faith
on your part,

2426
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,630
but you've got
to hear me out.

2427
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,600
Oh, here comes
an avalanche of bullshit.

2428
01:57:17,660 --> 01:57:19,130
A little more faith
than that.

2429
01:57:23,500 --> 01:57:24,440
No, listen,
I don't want to hear

2430
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:25,440
anything
you have to say.

2431
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:27,560
You have every
right to be...

2432
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,700
Um, I'll just have
a coffee, thanks.

2433
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,710
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

2434
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:34,840
Why is it
free of charge?

2435
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,010
Don't... Don't ask.

2436
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,140
Whatever.

2437
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:39,850
I'll have the clam chowder,
the fried chicken

2438
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,010
with the baked potato
with everything,

2439
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:42,560
and a chocolate
chiffon pie.

2440
01:57:42,620 --> 01:57:44,720
Clean food, please.

2441
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:46,550
In that case, sir,
may I advise against

2442
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:47,850
the lady eating
the clam chowder?

2443
01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:49,920
No clam chowder,
thank you.

2444
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:53,660
You've got
about 30 seconds.

2445
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,300
Marla, I know that
I've been acting

2446
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,600
very, very strange.

2447
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:00,830
OK, I know that
it's got to seem

2448
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:01,970
like there's
2 sides to me...

2449
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:02,970
2 sides?

2450
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,310
You're Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Jackass.

2451
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,310
I deserve that,
but...

2452
01:58:05,410 --> 01:58:06,570
I've come
to realize something

2453
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:07,580
very, very
important.

2454
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,710
What?

2455
01:58:08,780 --> 01:58:10,220
The full extent
of our relationship

2456
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,310
wasn't really clear
to me up until now,

2457
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,610
for reasons I'm not
going to go into,

2458
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:15,120
but the important
thing is, I know

2459
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:16,380
that I haven't been
treating you so nice.

2460
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:17,390
Yeah, whatever.

2461
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,420
No, no...
15 seconds.

2462
01:58:18,490 --> 01:58:19,690
15 seconds,
please, please.

2463
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:21,590
15 seconds, don't
open your mouth.

2464
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:24,220
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm sorry.

2465
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:25,490
Because what
I've come to realize

2466
01:58:25,570 --> 01:58:28,300
is that I really
like you, Marla.

2467
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,830
You do?

2468
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,430
I really do.

2469
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:33,470
I care about you

2470
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,560
and I don't want
anything bad

2471
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,200
to happen to you
because of me.

2472
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,970
Marla, your life
is in danger.

2473
01:58:41,110 --> 01:58:42,050
What?

2474
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,520
You need to leave
town for a while.

2475
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:45,850
Get out of
any major city

2476
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,050
and just go camping
or something.

2477
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,180
You're an insane person.

2478
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:49,310
No, no,
I've involved you

2479
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:51,220
in something terrible
that's about to happen.

2480
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,720
No.
Shut up,

2481
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:53,950
shut up!

2482
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,890
Listen,
I tried, Tyler.

2483
01:58:58,970 --> 01:59:00,130
I really tried.

2484
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:01,130
I know you did.

2485
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:03,170
There are things
about you I like.

2486
01:59:03,240 --> 01:59:04,730
You're smart,
you're funny,

2487
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:07,170
you're spectacular
in bed.

2488
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:10,370
But you're
intolerable.

2489
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:13,340
You have very serious
emotional problems.

2490
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:15,210
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek

2491
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:16,610
professional help.

2492
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:18,080
I know,
and I'm sorry.

2493
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:19,020
Yeah, you're sorry,
I'm sorry,

2494
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:20,210
everyone's sorry.
But...

2495
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:23,450
I can't
do this anymore.

2496
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,080
I can't.

2497
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:27,150
And I won't.

2498
01:59:28,730 --> 01:59:29,750
I'm gone.

2499
01:59:31,470 --> 01:59:32,360
You can't leave,
Marla,

2500
01:59:32,470 --> 01:59:34,170
you're not safe!

2501
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:38,970
No!
Leave me alone!

2502
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,900
Marla, I'm trying
to protect you.

2503
01:59:40,970 --> 01:59:42,500
I don't ever want
to see you again!

2504
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:44,240
That's fine, if
that's what it takes...

2505
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:45,640
You wait.
Wait right here.

2506
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:51,250
Hold it
right there.

2507
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,310
Shut up!

2508
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:55,250
Take this money
and get on this bus.

2509
01:59:55,290 --> 01:59:56,260
And I promise you

2510
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:57,310
I will never
bother you again

2511
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:58,290
if that's
what you want.

2512
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,620
Shut up!

2513
01:59:59,690 --> 02:00:01,020
Please get
on the bus.

2514
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:02,490
Please get
on the bus!

2515
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:05,390
Why are you
doing this?

2516
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,090
Because they think you're
some kind of a threat.

2517
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,260
I... I can't explain it
right now,

2518
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:09,270
just trust me.

2519
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,270
If I see
where you're going,

2520
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,270
you will
not be safe.

2521
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:12,530
I'm not paying
this back.

2522
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:14,070
I consider it
asshole tax.

2523
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,230
That's fine. Remember,
stay out of major cities

2524
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:17,400
for at least
a couple of days, OK?

2525
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:18,410
Tyler.

2526
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:21,340
You're
the worst thing

2527
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:22,850
that ever
happened to me.

2528
02:00:37,930 --> 02:00:39,300
Hello.

2529
02:00:39,330 --> 02:00:40,960
I need you
to arrest me.

2530
02:00:41,030 --> 02:00:43,300
I am the leader of
a terrorist organization

2531
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:45,700
responsible for numerous
acts of vandalism,

2532
02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:47,430
and assault
all over this city.

2533
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:49,770
...in the
metropolitan area,

2534
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,330
with probably a couple
hundred members.

2535
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,540
Chapters
have sprung up

2536
02:00:53,610 --> 02:00:56,340
in 5 or 6 other
major cities already.

2537
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:59,480
This is a tightly
regimented organization,

2538
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:01,680
with many cells
capable of operating

2539
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,780
completely independent
of central leadership.

2540
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:06,990
Look, look,
go to that house, OK?

2541
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:09,190
1537 Paper Street.

2542
02:01:09,260 --> 02:01:11,200
That's our headquarters.

2543
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,790
In the back,
buried in the garden,

2544
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:16,960
you'll find the body
of Robert Paulson.

2545
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:18,970
In the basement,

2546
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:20,230
you're gonna find
some bathtubs

2547
02:01:20,310 --> 02:01:21,830
that have been used
very recently

2548
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:25,940
to make large quantities
of nitroglycerin.

2549
02:01:26,010 --> 02:01:27,070
I believe the plan

2550
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:28,910
is to blow up
the headquarters

2551
02:01:28,980 --> 02:01:30,570
of these credit card
companies,

2552
02:01:30,650 --> 02:01:32,480
and the T.R.W. building.

2553
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:35,450
Why these buildings?

2554
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,580
Why credit card
companies?

2555
02:01:37,660 --> 02:01:39,450
If you erase
the debt record,

2556
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:42,050
then we all
go back to zero.

2557
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,150
It'll create
total chaos.

2558
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:47,920
Keep him talking.

2559
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:48,990
I need to make
a phone call.

2560
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,810
I really admire
what you're doing.

2561
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:04,380
What?

2562
02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:06,680
You're a brave man
to order this.

2563
02:02:06,750 --> 02:02:08,380
You're a genius,
sir.

2564
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,390
You said, if anyone
ever interferes

2565
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:13,260
with Project Mayhem...
even you...

2566
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:15,630
we gotta
get his balls.

2567
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:18,060
It's useless
to fight.

2568
02:02:18,130 --> 02:02:19,260
This is really
a powerful gesture,

2569
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:20,270
Mr. Durden.

2570
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:21,560
It'll set quite
an example.

2571
02:02:21,670 --> 02:02:23,760
You're making
a big mistake, fellas.

2572
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,770
You said
you'd say that.

2573
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,310
I'm not
Tyler Durden!

2574
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:27,900
You told us
you'd say that, too.

2575
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:30,810
All right,
I am Tyler Durden.

2576
02:02:30,880 --> 02:02:32,070
Listen to me,

2577
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:33,700
I'm giving you
a direct order.

2578
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:35,770
We are aborting this
mission, right now.

2579
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:37,250
You said you would
definitely say that.

2580
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:44,450
Are you fucking
out of your minds?

2581
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,860
You're
police officers!

2582
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:49,990
Somebody
timing this?

2583
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:51,000
No! No!

2584
02:02:51,060 --> 02:02:52,550
Keep your
mouth shut!

2585
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:54,570
Shit.

2586
02:02:57,340 --> 02:02:58,300
Yeah?

2587
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:59,400
Hey, you know, some
of this information

2588
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:00,770
checks out.

2589
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,360
Let's go over
to that house

2590
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:03,500
on Paper Street.

2591
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:04,670
Be right there.

2592
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:07,110
Hey! Wait!

2593
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:08,370
I got him.

2594
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:09,750
Sir, we have
to do this, sir.

2595
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:10,940
Stop fighting.

2596
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:12,310
Where's the rubber band?

2597
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,440
Get away from me!

2598
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,450
Drop that
fucking knife!

2599
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,450
Drop it!

2600
02:03:18,730 --> 02:03:19,620
Back up.

2601
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:20,780
Face down
on the floor,

2602
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:21,790
both of you,
right now!

2603
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:25,960
Get down
on the floor!

2604
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,510
First person comes out
this fucking door

2605
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:34,770
gets a... gets a lead salad,
you understand?

2606
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:01,660
Get away!
Get away!

2607
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:15,870
I ran.

2608
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:19,150
I ran until
my muscles burned

2609
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,310
and my veins pumped
battery acid.

2610
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:25,790
Then I ran
some more.

2611
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,230
What the fuck
are you doing?

2612
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:10,890
Running around
in your underpants.

2613
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:12,270
Man, you look
like a crazy person.

2614
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:14,070
No, I'm
onto you.

2615
02:05:14,140 --> 02:05:15,270
I know what's
going on here.

2616
02:05:15,310 --> 02:05:16,370
Well come on,
then.

2617
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:17,970
I got us a great place
to watch from.

2618
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:20,370
It'll be like
pay-per-view.

2619
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:10,300
Oh, Christ.

2620
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:12,260
Now what
are you doing?

2621
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:13,390
I'm stopping this.

2622
02:06:13,470 --> 02:06:16,490
Why? Greatest thing
you've ever done, man.

2623
02:06:16,570 --> 02:06:18,230
No, I can't
let this happen.

2624
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:19,790
You know there
are 10 other bombs

2625
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:21,340
in 10 other buildings.

2626
02:06:21,410 --> 02:06:22,770
God damn it, since when
is Project Mayhem

2627
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:23,770
about murder?

2628
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:25,170
The buildings
are empty.

2629
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:26,770
Security and maintenance,
all our people.

2630
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:28,070
We're not killing
anyone, man,

2631
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:29,340
we're setting 'em free.

2632
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:30,350
Bob is dead.

2633
02:06:30,420 --> 02:06:32,180
They shot him
in the head.

2634
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:33,480
You wanna
make an omelet,

2635
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:35,150
you gotta
break some eggs.

2636
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:36,450
No, I'm not
listening to you.

2637
02:06:36,520 --> 02:06:37,580
You're not
even there.

2638
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,370
Wouldn't do that.

2639
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:49,230
Not unless I knew which
wires were what.

2640
02:06:49,300 --> 02:06:50,960
If you know,
then I know.

2641
02:06:56,610 --> 02:06:57,540
Or...

2642
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:58,540
maybe I knew
you'd know,

2643
02:06:58,610 --> 02:06:59,640
so I spent
the whole day

2644
02:06:59,710 --> 02:07:00,910
thinking about
the wrong ones.

2645
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,510
You think?

2646
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,360
Oh, heavens no,
not the green one.

2647
02:07:15,530 --> 02:07:16,860
Pull any one
but the green one.

2648
02:07:22,740 --> 02:07:24,600
I asked you
not to do that!

2649
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:31,510
Tyler, get away
from the van.

2650
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:36,010
Tyler, I'm
not kidding!

2651
02:07:36,080 --> 02:07:37,980
Get away
from the van!

2652
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:39,310
God damn it!

2653
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:43,090
Whoa!

2654
02:07:46,290 --> 02:07:49,090
OK, you are now
firing a gun

2655
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,390
at your imaginary
friend

2656
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:53,190
near 400 gallons
of nitroglycerin!

2657
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:57,160
Look, Tyler,
Tyler!

2658
02:08:00,270 --> 02:08:01,470
Ahh!

2659
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:12,310
Aw, come on.

2660
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:13,550
Don't go.

2661
02:08:52,230 --> 02:08:53,350
What?!

2662
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:40,430
3 minutes.

2663
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,800
This is it.

2664
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,930
The beginning.

2665
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,980
Ground zero.

2666
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:49,010
I think this is about
where we came in.

2667
02:09:49,120 --> 02:09:50,080
Would you like
to say a few words

2668
02:09:50,150 --> 02:09:51,910
to mark the occasion?

2669
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,010
I'm sorry?

2670
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,720
I still can't think
of anything.

2671
02:09:59,390 --> 02:10:01,520
Ah, flashback humor.

2672
02:10:06,730 --> 02:10:08,390
It's getting
exciting now.

2673
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:11,790
2 and 1/2.

2674
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:12,800
Think of everything

2675
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:14,400
we've accomplished,
man.

2676
02:10:15,780 --> 02:10:17,610
Out these windows,
we will view

2677
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:19,300
the collapse
of financial history.

2678
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:22,810
One step closer to
economic equilibrium.

2679
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,160
Why is she here?

2680
02:10:39,230 --> 02:10:41,170
Tying up loose ends.

2681
02:10:41,230 --> 02:10:44,290
Put me down,
you bald-headed fucks!

2682
02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:45,600
I'm begging you,

2683
02:10:45,670 --> 02:10:46,600
please don't
do this.

2684
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:47,600
I'm not doing this.

2685
02:10:47,670 --> 02:10:49,370
We are doing this.

2686
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,500
This is what we want.

2687
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:52,640
No, I don't
want this.

2688
02:10:52,710 --> 02:10:55,840
Right, except you
is meaningless now.

2689
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:57,580
We have to forget
about you.

2690
02:10:57,650 --> 02:10:59,910
Jesus, you're
a voice in my head.

2691
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:01,280
You're a voice
in mine.

2692
02:11:01,350 --> 02:11:02,820
You're a fucking
hallucination,

2693
02:11:02,890 --> 02:11:04,020
why can't I
get rid of you?

2694
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:05,020
You need me.

2695
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:07,300
No, I don't,
I really don't anymore.

2696
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,380
Hey, you created me.

2697
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,260
I didn't create
some loser alter ego

2698
02:11:10,300 --> 02:11:11,760
to make myself
feel better.

2699
02:11:11,830 --> 02:11:12,890
Take some
responsibility.

2700
02:11:12,970 --> 02:11:14,190
I do.

2701
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:16,260
I am responsible
for all of it,

2702
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:17,390
and I
accept that.

2703
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:19,730
So please,
I'm begging you,

2704
02:11:19,810 --> 02:11:21,470
please
call this off.

2705
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:25,670
Have I ever
let us down?

2706
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:29,440
How far have you come
because of me?

2707
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:37,380
I will bring us
through this.

2708
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:39,390
As always,

2709
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:41,650
I will carry you,
kicking and screaming,

2710
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:43,850
and in the end,
you will thank me.

2711
02:11:43,930 --> 02:11:45,830
Tyler.

2712
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:48,090
Tyler, I'm
grateful to you

2713
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:49,430
for everything

2714
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:50,490
that you've
done for me.

2715
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:52,130
But this
is too much.

2716
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:53,730
I don't
want this.

2717
02:11:53,810 --> 02:11:54,740
What do you want?!

2718
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:56,070
Want to go back
to the shit job,

2719
02:11:56,140 --> 02:11:58,610
fucking condo world,
watching sitcoms?

2720
02:11:58,680 --> 02:12:00,650
Fuck you.
I won't do it.

2721
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:03,380
Oh, God, this
can't be happening.

2722
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:05,920
It's already done,
so shut up.

2723
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,920
60 seconds.

2724
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:08,350
Can you see
alright?

2725
02:12:11,220 --> 02:12:12,620
I can figure this out.

2726
02:12:12,690 --> 02:12:14,280
I can figure this out,
this isn't even real.

2727
02:12:14,330 --> 02:12:16,320
You're not real,
that gun isn't...

2728
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,160
That gun isn't
even in your hand.

2729
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:21,190
The gun's in my hand.

2730
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:29,240
Hey, good for you.
Doesn't change a thing.

2731
02:12:38,120 --> 02:12:40,810
Why do you want to put
a gun to your head?

2732
02:12:40,890 --> 02:12:43,720
Not my head, Tyler.

2733
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:45,550
Our head.

2734
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:48,690
Interesting.

2735
02:12:52,060 --> 02:12:54,830
Where are you going
with this, I KEA boy?

2736
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:05,070
Hey, it's you
and me.

2737
02:13:08,050 --> 02:13:08,980
Friends.

2738
02:13:11,020 --> 02:13:11,950
Tyler...

2739
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:17,860
I want you to
really listen to me.

2740
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:18,860
OK.

2741
02:13:21,890 --> 02:13:23,590
My eyes are open.

2742
02:13:41,410 --> 02:13:43,280
What's that smell?

2743
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:05,130
Where is
everybody?

2744
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:06,400
I don't know,
what's goin' on?

2745
02:14:07,470 --> 02:14:08,740
Mr. Durden!

2746
02:14:09,810 --> 02:14:11,170
Oh, my God.

2747
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:12,180
Sir?

2748
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:17,840
Are you, uh...

2749
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,750
Are you
alright, sir?

2750
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:21,050
Oh, yeah, I'm OK.

2751
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,050
You look
terrible, sir.

2752
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,780
What happened?

2753
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:26,050
Oh, nothing.
It's no problem.

2754
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:27,890
Oh, no, no, sir,
he's not kidding.

2755
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,120
You look
really awful.

2756
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,320
You need medical
assistance.

2757
02:14:30,430 --> 02:14:31,900
- I'm fine.
- Ugh.

2758
02:14:31,960 --> 02:14:32,950
Look, I'm fine.

2759
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:35,520
Everything's fine.

2760
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,060
Let... Let her go.

2761
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:42,130
Christ
almighty!

2762
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:44,070
You!

2763
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:46,580
Hi, Marla.

2764
02:14:47,650 --> 02:14:48,610
Leave her
with me,

2765
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:49,610
get your stuff,

2766
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:50,610
I'll meet you
downstairs.

2767
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:51,620
Are you sure?

2768
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:53,650
Yes, I'm sure.

2769
02:14:54,820 --> 02:14:56,790
You fucker!

2770
02:14:56,860 --> 02:14:57,790
What kind of sick
fucking game

2771
02:14:57,860 --> 02:14:58,790
are you
playing now,

2772
02:14:58,860 --> 02:14:59,790
putting me
on a fucking bu...

2773
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:01,760
Oh, my God,
your face!

2774
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:03,260
Yeah, I know.

2775
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:10,000
What happened?

2776
02:15:10,070 --> 02:15:11,230
Don't ask.

2777
02:15:11,300 --> 02:15:12,240
You're shot.

2778
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,670
Yes, I'm shot.

2779
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:15,260
Oh, my God.

2780
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:16,770
I can't believe
he's standing.

2781
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,280
One tough
motherfucker.

2782
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:24,010
Who did this?

2783
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:26,610
I did, actually.

2784
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:28,080
Find some gauze.

2785
02:15:30,090 --> 02:15:32,150
You shot
yourself?

2786
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:33,280
Yes, but it's OK.

2787
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:34,920
Marla, look at me.

2788
02:15:34,990 --> 02:15:37,260
I'm really OK.

2789
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:39,290
Trust me.

2790
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:41,090
Everything's
gonna be fine.

2791
02:15:54,180 --> 02:15:55,980
You met me at
a very strange time

2792
02:15:56,050 --> 02:15:57,310
in my life.

2793
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:00,840
With your feet
on the air

2794
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:03,390
And your head
on the ground

2795
02:16:06,660 --> 02:16:10,990
Try this trick
and spin it, yeah

2796
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:13,960
Your head'll
collapse

2797
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:15,760
If there's
nothing in it

2798
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,100
And you'll ask
yourself

2799
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:26,780
Where is my mind?

2800
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:40,820
Way out in the water,
see it swimming

2801
02:16:46,630 --> 02:16:50,330
I was swimming
in the Caribbean

2802
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:58,770
Animals were hiding
behind the rock

2803
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,940
Except for little fish

2804
02:17:01,010 --> 02:17:02,310
When they told me
east is west

2805
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:04,580
Trying to talk
to me, coy koi

2806
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:14,060
Where is my mind?

2807
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:28,170
Way out in the water,
see it swimming

2808
02:17:41,450 --> 02:17:42,850
With your feet
on the air

2809
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:45,480
And your head
on the ground

2810
02:17:48,490 --> 02:17:52,330
Try this trick
and spin it, yeah

2811
02:17:54,030 --> 02:17:57,530
Your head'll collapse
if there's nothing in it

2812
02:17:57,640 --> 02:17:59,700
And you'll ask yourself

2813
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:08,940
Where is my mind?

2814
02:18:16,260 --> 02:18:22,820
Way out in the water,
see it swimming
